This is insane
All you did was say hello
Speak my name
Feeling your love
Like a love I used to know
Long ago.
How can it be
You're a different space and time
Come to me.
Feel like I'm home
In a place I used to know
Long ago
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that I once knew
Is it you
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that might come true
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja vu
This is devine
I've been waiting all my life
Filling time
Looking for you
Nights were more than you could know
Long ago
Come to me now
We don't have to dream of love
We know how
Somewhere before
It's as if I've loved you so
So long ago
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that I once knew
Is it you
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja vu
