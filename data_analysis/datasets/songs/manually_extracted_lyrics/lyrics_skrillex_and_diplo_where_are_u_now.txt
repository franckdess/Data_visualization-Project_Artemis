I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you the most.
I gave you the key
When the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith
Turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down
I didn't leave ya
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya? Where are you now that I need ya? Where are you now that I need ya? I gave you attention
When nobody else was payin
' I gave you the shirt off my back What you sayin'
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin
' That's for sure And I was on my knees When nobody else was prayin', oh lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you Where are you now that I need you? I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you I need you the most
Where are you now that I need ya? Where are you now that I need ya? Where are you now that I need ya? I need you the most
I need you the most
I need you the most
