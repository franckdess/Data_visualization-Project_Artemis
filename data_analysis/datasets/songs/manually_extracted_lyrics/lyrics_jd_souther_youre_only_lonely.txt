When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders
And, when you're feeling lonely and small,
You need somebody there to hold you;
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely;
Now, don't you ever be ashamed;
You're only lonely.
When you need somebody around on the nights that try you
I was there when you were a queen
And I'll be the last one there beside you;
So you can call out my name
When you're only lonely;
Now, don't you ever be ashamed;
You're only lonely. (You're only lonely)
(You're only lonely) (You're only lonely)
Ooh, When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders
And, when you're feeling lonely and small,
You need somebody there to hold you;
So don't you ever be ashamed
When you're only lonely;
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely; (You're only lonely)
When you're only lonely; (You're only lonely)
Ooh, it's no crime,
Darlin', we got lots of time,
Woh, woh, (You're only lonely)
Woh, woh, woh, (You're only lonely)
No there's nothing wrong with you,
Darlin, I get lonely too.
(You're only lonely)(You're only lonely)
So, if you need me, (You're only lonely)
All you've gotta do is call me
Well, you're only lonely
(You're only lonely)(You're only lonely)
Ooh, ooh, (You're only lonely)
