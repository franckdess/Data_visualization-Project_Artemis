I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
And three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in the cold december
But i've got you to keep me warm
If you're broke then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on
I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things i've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things i've done
I think I love you better now
Now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right
We could frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But i've been here before
Now i'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things i've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things i've done
I think I love you better now
