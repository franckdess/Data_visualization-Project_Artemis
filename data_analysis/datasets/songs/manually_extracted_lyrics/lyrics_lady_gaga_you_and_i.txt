It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you
You say sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's
, something, something about this place
(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about baby you and I
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you
Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's
, something, something about this place
(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about baby you and I
You and I
You you and I
You you and I
You you and I
You and I
You you and I
Oh yeah, we're gonna die
Without you and I
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ
I am a New York woman born to rock you down
So want my lipstick all over your face
(Something), something, something about just knowing when it's right
So put your dreams up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you
You and I
You you and I
Baby I'd rather die
Without you and I
You and I
You you and I
Nebraska
I'd rather die
Without you and I
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you
