Good morning, sun, I say it's good to see you shining
I know my baby brought you to me
She kissed me yesterday, hello to silver lining
Got spring and summer running through me

Hey, 98.6, it's good to have you back again
Oh, hey, 98.6, her lovin' is the medicine that saved me
Oh, I love my baby

Hey, everybody on the street, I see you smiling
Must be because I found my baby
You know she's got me on another kind of highway
I want to go to where it takes me

Hey, 98.6, it's good to have you back again
Oh, hey, 98.6, her lovin' is the medicine that saved me
Oh, I love my baby

You know she's got me on another kind of highway
I want to go to where it takes me

Hey, 98.6, it's good to have you back again
Oh, hey, 98.6, her lovin' is the medicine that saved me
Oh, I love my baby
