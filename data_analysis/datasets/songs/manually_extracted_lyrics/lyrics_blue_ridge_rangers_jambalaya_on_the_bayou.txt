Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou
Well Thibodeaux, fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style, go hog wild and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou, oh, guitar
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou
Oh, Lord, hang tight, ooh Lord
Ah, take it out, here comes, ah
