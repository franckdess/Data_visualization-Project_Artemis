They tell me you're shy boy
But I want you just the same
Don't play innocent with me
You know it's just not fun and games
When I look into your eyes
So much passion burns inside
But if you need some coaxing
I will do it
Step by step there's nothing to it

1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you're mine

Come out of your shell boy
You know we go like hand in glove
You're afraid to giving in
But I'm never giving up on your love
And no matter what it takes
I will steal your heart away
Take a chance for once you won't regret it
Want my love just come and get it

1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you're mine

So no matter what it takes
I will steal your heart away
Take a chance for once you won't regret it
Take my love just come and get it

1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you're mine
