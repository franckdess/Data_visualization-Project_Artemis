He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts
Rest assured this troubadour is acting on His part
The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name
There is love, there is love
Well a man shall leave his mother, and a woman leave her home
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning is now until the end
A woman draws her life from man and gives it back again
And there is love, there is love
Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife
Is it love that brings you here or love that gives you life
For if loving is the answer then who's the giving for
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before
Oh there's love, oh there's love
Oh, the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name
There is love, oh there's love
