I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
After all this time of being alone
We can love on another
Feel for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met, I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love to you
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met, I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love to you
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met
I knew I'd have a never ending love for you
