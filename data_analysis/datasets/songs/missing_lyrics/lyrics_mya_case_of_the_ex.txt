Yeah, Mýa
Red zone what what?

It's after midnight and she's on your phone (Phone)
Saying come over cause she's all alone (Lone)
I could tell it was your ex by your tone (Tone)
Why is she calling now after so long?

Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me what is it that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz
That you just bought for me?
Cause y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96

What you gon' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show, boy I really need to know and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you gon' do when she wants you back?
What you gon' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show, boy I really need to know and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you gon' do when she wants you back?

There's no need to reminisce 'bout the past
Obviously cause that shit did not last
I know how a woman will try to game you
Don't get caught up because baby you'll lose

Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me what is it that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz

Tell me why she on the phone in the middle of the night?
Tell me why she in your life tryna get what's mine?
She don't know me, she's about to know me
I'm in your life, that's how it's gon' be
I seen her photo, she ain't even all that
So if you want her back you can take her back
Cause game recognize game, I can do the same thing
Get it right, change or take back this ring!

What you gon' do when you can't say no?
