I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new - yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
I'm sorry like an angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off
The ground
