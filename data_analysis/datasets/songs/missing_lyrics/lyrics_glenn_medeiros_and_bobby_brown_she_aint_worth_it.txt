Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time
One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try
You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?
You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again


I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)
Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine
For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye
She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again
