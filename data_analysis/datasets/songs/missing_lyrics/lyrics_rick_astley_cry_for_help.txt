She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure
It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame
Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems
Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?
I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?
All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help
No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help
Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help
Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help
Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?
All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Why don't I hear her cry for help?
All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help
All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Is it so hard to cry for help?
(Cry for help is all I need)
No need to feel ashamed
(All I need is a cry for help)
Come on and release the pain
(Cry for help is all I need)
Put your trust in me
(All I need is a cry for help)
My love is gonna set you free
