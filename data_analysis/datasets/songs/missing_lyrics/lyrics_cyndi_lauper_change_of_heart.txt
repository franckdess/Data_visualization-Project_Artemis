Here I am
Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend
Just like you think it should be
Did you think I would stand here and lie?
While our moment was passing us by
Oh, while I'm here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around

Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If its truth that you're looking to find
And its nowhere outside of your mind
When I bide my time

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around

And I'm waiting for your change of heart
Waiting for your change of heart
