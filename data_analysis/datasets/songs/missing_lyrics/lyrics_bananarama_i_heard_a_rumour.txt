Who needs friends who never show
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
Those lonely nights
(I'm just thinking about when I waited)
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out
All my friends were right
('Til I found out, ooh, ooh)
I didn't know you at all
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
Baby, I'm too afraid
So you realise what hurt you made
(So you realise the love)
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
(How can I forgive, ooh, ooh)
It's never gonna be the same
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh
