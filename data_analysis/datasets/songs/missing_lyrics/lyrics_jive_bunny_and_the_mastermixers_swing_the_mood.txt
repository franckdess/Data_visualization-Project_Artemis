It's 4 o'clock and we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie wake up littel Susie

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
You're crying all the time
You make up looking like a hound dog
Crying all the time
We'll you ain't ever called a rammin' and you're ain't
No friend of mine
Shake, shake, shake, shake, rattle and roll I said
Shake, rattle and roll, I said
Shake, rattle and roll, I said
Shake, rattle and roll
Oh with the bless of my soul, oh won't you
Roll with me, I met you like a man on a fossil tree
My friend said I might think what's the bog
I made for love, I'm all shook up
RRRRock one threw a party in the canned jail
The prison band was here
They began the whole
The band was jumpin' and they jumped again the swing
You should've heard the knock out jail
First singing
Let's rock, everybody let's rock everybody
In the whole state of rock will dance
In the jails of rock
Ah ah ah ah
Bump, bump
