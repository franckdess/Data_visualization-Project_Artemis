Never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so
That I never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
It says, "Turn around you fool
You know, you love her more and more"
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no
Ooh oh
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no no
I never can say goodbye
I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hang up
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh
Oh, I never can say you goodbye girl
Ooh
I never can say you goodbye
No no no, no no no ooh
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh, ooh
I never can say goodbye girl
Ooh
