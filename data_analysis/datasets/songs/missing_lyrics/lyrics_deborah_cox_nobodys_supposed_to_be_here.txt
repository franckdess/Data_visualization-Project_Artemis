How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here
I tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says "No, no." Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around, again, love has knocked me down
My heart got broken, oh it hurts so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time to take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here


This time I swear I'm through
But, if only you knew how many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance, and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things
