You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
If you're feeling sad and blue
Come on and dance with me
I can make your dreams come true
Come on and dance with me
Ladies, get up off your seats
Come on and dance with me
Gentlemen, get on your feet
Come on and dance with me
Say the word and I'll summon the band
With my hand
Let your mind and your body be free
Dance with me
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
Got to feel it in your soul
Come on and dance with me
Got to make you lose control
Come on and dance with me
When we play the music tight
Then you should dance with me
Got you higher than a kite
Come on and dance with me
Say the word and I'll summon the band
With my hand
Let your mind and your body be free
Dance with me, ha
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
If you're free and you like what you see
Dance with me
You got to keep dancing 'cause it's making me high
You got to keep, keep dancing
You got to keep dancing 'cause it's making me high
You got to keep, keep dancing
You got to keep dancing 'cause it's making me high (You gotta keep on makin' me high)
You got to keep, keep dancing (You gotta keep on makin' me high)
You got to keep dancing 'cause it's making me high (You gotta keep on makin' me high)
You got to keep, keep dancing (You gotta keep on makin' me high)
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on makin' me high
If you're feeling sad and blue
Come on and dance with me
I can make your dreams come true
Come on and dance with me
Say the word and I'll summon the band
With my hand
Let your mind and your body be free
Dance with me
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on
You gotta keep on makin' me high
You gotta keep on
Let your mind and your body be free
