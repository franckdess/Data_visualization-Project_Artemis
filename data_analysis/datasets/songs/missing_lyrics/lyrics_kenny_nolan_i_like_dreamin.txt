I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light
I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine
We've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times
Hand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand
Side by side, the tide rolls in
I'm touching you, you're touching me
If only it could be
I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light
Through each dream, how our love has grown
I see us with our children and our happy home
Little smiles, so warm and tender looking up at us
Blessed by love, the one we shared
Till I wake, and reach for you
And you're just not there
I like dreamin' 'cause dreaming can make you mine
I like holding you close and touching your skin
Even if it's in my mind
Oh, sweet dream baby, I love you
Oh, my sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night
Oh sweet dreams, I like feelin you
Oh sweet dreams baby, Don't keep me waiting all my life
