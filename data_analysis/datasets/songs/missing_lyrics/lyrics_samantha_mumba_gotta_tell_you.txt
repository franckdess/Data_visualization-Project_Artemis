Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowin' inside me like never before
Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feelin' just burst inside
There was only you, nobody else
But baby, I know better now

Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And now you're back inside my house again
I'm tryin' deeper to explain
'Cause baby, I wanna get it on
And baby, you're the one for me
But now that I have got you all alone
After all this talkin' on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you belong

Don't wanna love you if you don't love me (If you don't love me)
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me (If you don't love me)
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight

It was just something in your eyes
That made me realize
But now I hear voices deep inside
Tellin' me, tellin' me
It's you and I

Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me (If you don't love me)
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now, but it wouldn't be right
If I didn't tell you this tonight
