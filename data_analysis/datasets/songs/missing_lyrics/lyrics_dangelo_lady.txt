Don't think I don't see them looking at ya
All of them wishing they could have ya
And as a matter of fact, uh
A bunch of them are itchin'for you to scratch'em
I'm tired of hiding what we feel
I'm trying to come with the real
And I'm-a gonna make it know
Cause I want them to know

You're my lady
You're my lady

You're my little baby, my darling baby
I swear you're the talk of the town
And everybody wants to know what's going down
Babe, I know they've seen us before
Maybe at the liquor store, or maybe at the health food stand
They don't know that I'm your man

You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady

I can tell they're looking at us
I pick you up every day from your job
(You're my lady)
And every guy in the parking lot wants to rob me of my girl
And my heart and soul, and everybody wants to treat me so cold
But I know I love you and you love me
There's no other lover for you or me
You're my lady

I can tell they're looking at us
I can tell they're looking at us
I can tell they're looking at us
