This time a mystery check the history 
From you hear my voice it's no secret
Cheerleader song but the words sing along 
No someone to dip on the remix
Me a di a di girl inna the tight up skirt 
But ooh they call me cheerleader
Pom poms in my hand when I sing dis song
Oh maybe they turn on the speaker

Say oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

When I need motivation, my one solution
Is my queen 'cause she stay strong yeah yeah 
She's always in my corner right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone 
And they say
Do you need me 
Do you think I'm pretty 
Do I make you feel like cheating
I'm like no not really (nuh uh) 

'Cause oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

If its wrong I don't care I'mma right this 
Thinks you don't have me flying the highest 
Say what say what you want call me like it
For the haters out there you can bite this
I'mma walk like a model talk like a model 
Call me mischief may 'cause because I'mma model
Been looking like say I won the lotto 
If I were a ooh then I'm off there singing like 

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention 
You're the only girl for me 
No I don't need no next one
Mama loves you too 
She thinks I made the right selection
All there's left to do is
Ask the question 

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
