If you want it, here it is come and get it
Mm-mm-mm-mm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?
If you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
If you want it, here it is come and get it
Mm-mm-mm-mm, make your mind up fast
If you want it, anytime I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?
Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Ooh-ooh-ooh, fool and his money
Sonny, if you want it, here it is come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You'd better hurry 'cause it's going fast
