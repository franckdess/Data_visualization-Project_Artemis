Well if I could walk on water
And if I could find some way to prove
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is so true
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, etc.)
Well I'm no angel, now, I'll admit
I made a few bad moves I should regret
I hurt you once or so you said
Just one more chance is all you get
Didn't mean to do you wrong again
Worse things have been done by better men
Baby, baby, don't, don't treat me this way
I know, yes, I've got to pay now, I'm still paying
Well if I could walk on water
And if I could find some way to prove
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is true
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh
All along, I told you lies
To err is human, forgive is divine
Don't be a fool, don't settle the score
Cause I can't take it no more, I can't take it
Well if I could walk on water
And if I could find some way to prove
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is true
Well, if I could walk on water (if I could)
Is that what I'm gonna have to do?
If I could walk on water, would be you believe in me?
My love is so true
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, etc.)
Do I have to walk, walk, walk on water for you
Hey baby, baby, there's a little time
Let's spend it together
We'll get over what we left behind
There's our future together
Yeah, well, let's stay together
I keep walking and walking and walking
For you, for you
Well if I could walk on water
And if I could find some way to prove
If I could walk on water, would you believe in me?
My love is true
My love is so true
Do I have to walk, oh, walk on water for you?
Baby, please
If I had to walk, girl
If I had to walk, walk, walk
Do I have to walk on water, walk on water for you?
Do I have to walk on water?
Do I have to find some way to prove?
Do I have to walk on water, walk on water for you?
Do I have to walk on water?
Do I have to find some way to prove?
Yeah, yeah, walk on water, walk on water for you...
