This is a Missy Elliott one-time exclusive, come on

Is it worth it? Let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
If you got a big *elephant trumpet*, let me search ya
And find out how hard I gotta work ya
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
Ti esrever dna ti pilf, nwod gniht ym tup
C'mon

I'd like to get to know ya so I could show ya
Put the pussy on ya like I told ya
Give me all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank, then call me over
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or won't ya?
Go downtown and eat it like a vulture
See my hips and my tips, don't ya?
See my ass and my lips, don't ya?
Lost a few pounds and my waist for ya
This the kinda beat that go ra-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it, I need a glass of water
Boy, oh boy, it's good to know ya
C'mon

If you a fly gal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy, lift it up, let's make a toast-a
Let's get drunk, that's gonna bring us closer
Don't I look like a Halle Berry poster?
See the Belvedere playing tricks on ya
Girlfriend wanna be like me, never
You won't find a bitch that's even better
I make you hot as Las Vegas weather
Listen up close while I take it backwards
​sdrawkcab ti ekat ot ekil yssiM yaw eht hctaW
I'm not a prostitute, but I could give you what you want
I love your braids and your mouth full of fronts
Love the way my ass go bum-bum-bum-bum
Keep your eyes on my bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
You think you can handle this badonka-donk-donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights on so you see what I could do
C'mon

Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, White, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys (C'mon)
Why-thai, thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai
Rock-thai, thai-o-toy-o-thai-thai (C'mon)
Girls, girls, get that cash
If it's 9 to 5 or shaking your ass (Aha)
Ain't no shame, ladies do your thing (C'mon)
Just make sure you ahead of the game
Just 'cause I got a lot of fame super
Prince couldn't get me change my name, papa
Kunta Kinte a slave again, no sir
Picture blacks saying, “Oh yes'a, massa”
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute Man and Big Red could outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matter
Why you act dumb like, uh, duh?
So you act dumb like, uh, duh
As the drummer boy go ba-rom-pop-pom-pom
Give you some-some-some of this Cinnabun
C'mon

To my fellas (Ooh good god!)
I like the way you work that (Uh huh, la-la-la-la)
To my ladies (Whoo! Good god!)
You sure know how to work that
Yeah, it's Missy Elliott!
I hope y'all enjoying what y'all heard so far
I was sittin' here thinkin' like
Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy
Salt n Pepa, Lyte, EPMD, LL, Run-DMC
KRS-One, Rakim
Most of them artists used to dance
And still get respected in the street
Don't be scared to Bankhead or Bogo
Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever
Let's just have fun, it's hip-hop man, this is hip-hop!
