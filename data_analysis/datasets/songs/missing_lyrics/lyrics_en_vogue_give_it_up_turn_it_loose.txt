I believe in yesterday

What's the problem?
You keep comin' in and keep comin' out and singin' flat
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
What's wrong? What's wrong?
You're not concentrating
Yes, I am concentrating
No, you're not
I'm sorry, let's just do it again
No no no, uh uh - what's the problem?
There's no problem
Dawn, what's wrong?
There's nothing wrong, Terry
Kevin
Mhm
Please don't tell me it's Kevin
Mhm
Ew, Kevin Swahili, I knew it! He's got cooties
And he's seeing Tamika right now
And everybody else
He is not seeing Raneka
He is
How you know?
Wait a minute you guys
Wait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her
It sounds like it's serious because we can't concentrate and get this right
So, let's deal with the problem
You see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk
And it goes a little something like this - hit it
Mmm...

Baby girl (Unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (A fool)
Tears for fears (Are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (Is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life

I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, yeah

Fact of life (So sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (Nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (Bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come

I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, yeah

(Give it up) Give it up, oh
(Give up) Give it up
(Give up) Give it up
(Give it up, turn it loose) Turnin' it loose, baby
(Give up) Give it up
(Give up) Give it up
(Give it up, turn it loose) Turnin' it loose, baby
(Give up) Give it, give it, give it, give it
(Give up) Give it, give it, give it, give it
(Give it up, turn it loose) And turn it loose
(Give up) Hey
(Give up) Turn it loose
(Give it up, turn it loose)
