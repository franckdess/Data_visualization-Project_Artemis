Here they come again, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Catch us if you can, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Time to get a move on, (mmmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might

Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can
Catch us if you can

Now we gotta run, (mmmm-mm-mm)
No more time for fun, (mmmm-mm-mm)
When we're gettin' angry, (mmmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might



Here they come again, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Catch us if you can, (mmmm-mm-mm)
Time to get a move on, (mmmm-mm-mm)
We will yell with all of our might
