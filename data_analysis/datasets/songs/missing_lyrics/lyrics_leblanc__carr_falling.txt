I think about winter when I was with her
And the snow was falling down
Warmed by the fire, I love being by her
When there's no one else around
And I'm falling, oh, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you
I think about summer my head was swimming
You wrote my name in the sand
We walked together, hoping forever
Please don't let go of my hand
Cause I'm falling, oh, I'm falling
Oh, I'm falling in love with you
The fall and the springtime were like in-between times
You're here, and then you're gone away
Oh, I just wanted to say
Won't you please, please stay
Cause I'm falling, oh, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you
Oh, I'm falling, yeah, I'm falling
Oh, I'm falling in love with you
In love with you
In love with you
