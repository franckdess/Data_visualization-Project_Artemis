Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me
I'm so confused
Will you show it to me
That you'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry
Carry
Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Woo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Woo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart
