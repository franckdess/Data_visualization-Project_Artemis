Jesus loves the little children
All the little children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

There is none so blind
That is he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by
You know the world
Gets a little bit older
It's time to realize
That beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care
About the length of his hair
Or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now
Everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time
To look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way
One more time
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
