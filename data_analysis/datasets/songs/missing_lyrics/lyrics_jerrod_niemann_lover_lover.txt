Well the truth
Well it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to goin' I've got to say
I know you used to love me
But that was yesterday
And the truth, I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin you got to do whats right
Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Woah, lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Well the truth
Yeah, it hurts to say
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin back
But before I get to going
There was a time oh woman
When you used to shake it for me
Now all you do is treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more
Gonna walk out the door
Lover, lover, lover
You dont treat me no good no more
No, no, more more more
Woah, lover lover lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Yea, yea, yea
Well I went with you on a starry night
And Im hurtin' too bad cause you dont treat me right
Woman oh woman
You know I love you so
You're just so mean to me baby Im walkin out the door
Lover oh lover
I know you used to love me in every way, but now I'm givin up
And I'm tired of cryin babe
I can't stand it no longer
It hurts me to say
I'm packin up my bags and goin far away
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me good no more
