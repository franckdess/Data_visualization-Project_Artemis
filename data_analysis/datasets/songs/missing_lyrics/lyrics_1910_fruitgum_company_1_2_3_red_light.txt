Ev'ry time I try to prove I love you
1, 2, 3, Red Light
You stop me,.
Baby you ain't right to stop me
1, 2, 3, Red Light, you stop me
Ev'ry time I make a move to love you
1, 2, 3, Red Light, you stop me
Baby, ev'ry night you stop me
1, 2, 3, Red Light
Stop the game, you've got too much to lose
If you stop me again, that's when we might end
So please don't refuse
Ev'ry time I make a move to love you
1, 2, 3, Red Light, don't stop me
Baby you ain't right to stop me
1, 2, 3, Red Light won't stop me
Ev'ry time I try to prove I love you
1, 2, 3, Red Light won't stop me
When I know I'm right don't stop me
1, 2, 3, Red Light
