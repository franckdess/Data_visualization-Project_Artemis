What we gotta do right here is go back
Back into time
I love the way you make me feel (Okay)
I love it, I love it (Yeah)
I love the way you make me feel
I love it (Yeah), I love it (Yeah)

Say
I’m thinkin' ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (Love me not)
I ain’t a player, I just ***** * ***
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at a 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
And I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

So don’t you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way
(I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ohh, I love the way, the way I love you
(I love it, I love it)

Ohh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin'
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question (Qu—qu—question)
'Cause, boy, I know just what you like

So if you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
Said I ain’t going nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper

So don’t you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way
(I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ohh, I love the way, the way I love you
(I love it, I love it)

Uh
I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feelin' lonely, so you sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me, American Beauty
Or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy, just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for ya I’m not gonna get bored of
But, baby, you an adventure so let me come and explore ya

So don’t you worry (Yeah)
Baby, you got me (Woo)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey) (Uh-huh)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)
