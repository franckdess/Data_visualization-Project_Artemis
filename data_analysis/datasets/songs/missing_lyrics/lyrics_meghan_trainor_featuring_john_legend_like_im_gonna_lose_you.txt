I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (Oh no)
'Cause no (No), we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)
I'm gonna hold you (Hey), like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing (Yeah), I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you), like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (Love you), like I'm gonna lose you
Hey

I'm gonna love you (Oh)
Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you, baby)
Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (Oh), like I'm gonna lose you
