I never needed love
Like I need you
And I never lived for nobody
But I live for you
Oooh, babe
Lost in love is what
I feel when I'm with you
Maybe it's the way you touch me
With the warmth of a sun
Maybe it's the way you smile
I come all undone
Oooh, babe
Lost in love is what
I feel when I'm with you
Baby, ooh, I get chills
When I'm with you, oh
Oh, baby, my world stands still
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I never cared for nobody
Like I care for you
And I never wanted
To share the things I want to share with you
Oooh, babe
Lost in love is what
I feel when I'm with you
Baby, ooh
I get chills
When I'm with you, oh...
Oh, baby, my world stands still
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
Whoa, oh, oh.....
Baby, ooh
I get chills
When I'm with you, oh...
Oh, baby, my world stands still
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
