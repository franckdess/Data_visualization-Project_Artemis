Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
Something so strong
Something so strong
Something so strong
Something, something so strong
