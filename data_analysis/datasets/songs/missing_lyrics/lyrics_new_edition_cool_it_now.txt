Everybody's saying silly things
Without knowing that life brings a change
And they've been checking all the signs
My friends say I'm love sick 'cause I

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is all about)
And I won't be the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love

Every day I walk her home from school
And she tells me, how she really feels
And there's no doubt in my mind
That this girl is one of a kind

'Cause all I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Understand you're one of a kind)
And I won't feel the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You better slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love
Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is all about)
And I'll never be the same until you are mine
And my friends keep telling me

When you got a girl who takes her time
You must slow the pace, you can't mess with her mind
If she feels the same, she'll let ya know
Just prepare yourself or be ready to go
And I hope this message stays in your mind
'Cause you almost lost a girl who is right on time
There's one more thing that you got to know
Just cool it down and stay in control!

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You better slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Understand you're one of a kind)
And I'll never be the same until you are mine, oh
Listen to me, let me tell you...

Why you all coming down on me?
Trying to tell me how my life is supposed to be
I know you're only trying to help me out
Trying to show me what life is really about
But this time I'm gonna make it on my own
So why don't you fellas just leave me alone
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
If I love the girl who cares who you like

Cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
Cool it now
Slow it down
Cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
Cool it now
Slow it down

Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
'Cause you're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love

Cool it now
Slow it down
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
'Cause you're gonna fall in love
Cool it now
Slow it down
'Cause you're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
Cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
Cool it now
Slow it down
