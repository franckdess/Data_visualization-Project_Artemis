Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get over, get over (listen)
Yeah, I was right there like a little wife
I was everything that you need, always in line
I was livin' you, lovin' you
Fillin' your desires
But that was then, this is now
Look me in the eye and
Oh, oh
If love could choose sides
Oh, oh
It's taking mine

Get over yourself, goodbye
It must be hard to be you, yeah
Livin' in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything, everything
Everything is alright
Get over yourself, know why
'Cuz without you
See I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything
Everything is alright

This just can't be it
I kept telling myself
And every magazine said
Was me was on the shelf
I was givin' out
Givin' in
Givin' away my dreams
You put it in
Put me down
Now I got my self-esteem
Oh, oh
Won't get me back, no
Oh, oh (no no)
You think I overreact, yeah


So now you wanna talk
Say let's do it just once more for luck
Like old times make up
Better yet, just forget
Better get over yourself
Stay in touch
When you learn a few things
About love (tell me baby)
Until then wake up
Better yet, better get
Better get over yourself
Get over yourself, goodbye
(Over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself
Get over yourself, goodbye
(Over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself
Get over yourself, goodbye
'Cuz without you
See I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything
Everything is alright
