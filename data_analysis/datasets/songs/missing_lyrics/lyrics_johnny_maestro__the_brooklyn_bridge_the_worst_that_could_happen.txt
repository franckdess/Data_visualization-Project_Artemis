Girl, I heard, you're getting married
Girl, I heard, you're getting married
This time you're really sure and this is the end
They say, you really mean it
This guy's the one that makes you feel
So safe, so sane and so secure
And baby, if he loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen to me
I'm never gettin' married, never gettin' married
You know that's not my scene
But a girl like you, needs to be married
I've known all along, you couldn't live forever in between
And baby, if he loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen, oh to me
And girl, I don't really blame you
For having a dream of your own
Hey girl, I don't really blame you
A woman like you needs a house and a home
Baby, if he really loves you more than me
Maybe it's the best thing
Maybe it's the best thing for you
But it's the worst that could happen
Oh girl, don't wanna get married
Girl, I'm never, never gonna marry, no no
Oh, it's the worst that could happen
The worst that could happen
Baby baby baby
The worst that could happen
