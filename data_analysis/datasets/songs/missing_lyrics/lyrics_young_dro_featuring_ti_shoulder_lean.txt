(feat. T.I.)
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Dro, I'm clean in dis b***h
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this b***h
N***a buck, carbon 15 in dis b***h
This Grand Hustle team of kings is getting rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of primotine mist
I ride 26, and let my nine screens flip
Trunk be watchin Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple black phantom, n***a nah it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charm diamonds man, but nah it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork and beans
Everybody know me in the club, cause they smoking me
Dro, h**s scoping me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm riding neon
Our cars look like crayon, h**s know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't how to dance though
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
First I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat, at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How then I pimp a foe, take a chick to Berlin
My chick break triggas, after that we take that girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Man is a child, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Man it think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot cause Atlanta, show killas with ammo
We ride phantoms, holler shorty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood playa from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin, shorty ride glazed on a haze
Gator green Chevy, gator gut, alligator J's
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Lean, lean (x8)
Get ya shoulder, shorty
Lean, lean (x8)
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean
