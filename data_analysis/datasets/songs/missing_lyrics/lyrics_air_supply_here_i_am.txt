Here I am
Playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you
A feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending
Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without you
On my own
I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you
Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without, go on without
It's just no good without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
