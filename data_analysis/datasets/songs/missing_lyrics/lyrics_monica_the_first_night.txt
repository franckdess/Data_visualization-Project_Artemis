Baby, Baby tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?

Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of getting in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinking

I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

We were chillin, watching your TV
I thought you were coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Try to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's getting too late
I'm thinking
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
(If) If you want me
You got to know me
And if you want my love
You gotta win my love
Hey baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me, get to know me
So we can do this
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night
