Babe, I'm leaving
I must be on my way
The time is drawing near
My train is going
I see it in your eyes
The love, the need, your tears
But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me
My heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

'Cause you know it's you, Babe
Whenever I get weary
And I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, Babe
Giving me the courage
And the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

You know it's you, Babe
Whenever I get weary
And I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, Babe
Giving me the courage
And the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

Babe, I'm leaving
I'll say it once again
And somehow try to smile
I know the feeling we're trying to forget
If only for a while
'Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
Please believe me
My heart is in your hands
'Cause I'll be missing you
Babe, I love you
Babe, I love you
Ooh, babe
