I'll be alone each and every night
While you're away, don't forget to write
Bye-bye, so long, farewell
Bye-bye, so long
See you in September
See you when the summer's through
Here we are (Bye, baby, goodbye)
Saying goodbye at the station (Bye, baby, goodbye)
Summer vacation (Bye, baby, bye, baby)
Is taking you away (Bye, baby, goodbye)
Have a good time, but remember
There is danger in the summer moon above
Will I see you in September
Or lose you to a summer love?
Counting the days till I'll be with you
Counting the hours and the minutes, too
Bye, baby, goodbye
Bye, baby, goodbye
Bye, baby, goodbye (Bye-bye, so long, farewell)
Bye, baby, goodbye (Bye-bye, so long)
Have a good time, but remember
There is danger in the summer moon above
Will I see you in September
Or lose you to a summer love?
I'll be alone each and every night
While you're away, don't forget to write
See you (Bye-bye, so long, farewell)
In September (Bye-bye, so long, farewell)
I'm hopin' I'll see you (Bye-bye, so long, farewell)
In September (Bye-bye, so long, farewell)
Well, maybe I'll see you (Bye-bye, so long, farewell)
