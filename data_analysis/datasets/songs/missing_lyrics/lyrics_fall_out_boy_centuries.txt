Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
Hey ya, remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Them bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is s'posed to match the darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
Hey ya, remember me for centuries

I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light
My shadow's over you, 'cause I, I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom, you're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
Hey ya, remember me for centuries

We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake is all it will take
We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries

Hey ya, oh hey
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
