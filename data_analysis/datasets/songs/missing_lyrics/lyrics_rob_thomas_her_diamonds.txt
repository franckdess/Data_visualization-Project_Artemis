'Oh what the hell' she says 'I just can't win for losing'
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says 'ooh
I can't take no more'
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down (way down)

Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night (all night)
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

So by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling
Oh I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She down with it
She tried her best and now she can't win, It's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down yeah
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling over her diamonds falling down
I can't take these diamonds falling down
