I'm your friend you can talk to me
I read your fate I see misery
'Cause the one you love has left you dry
Don't start believin' that you're gonna die
Just pick your heart up off the floor and try, try again
You'll find
Better love next time baby, don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time baby, someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love, better love, better love next time
Sometimes it's better to let it all go
I've been there and I think I should know
So have a good cry, wash out your heart
If you keep it inside it'll tear you apart
Sometimes you lose but you're gonna win if you just, if you just, keep hanging in
You'll find
Better love next time baby, don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time baby, someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love
Better love next time baby, don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time baby, someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love
Better love next time baby
