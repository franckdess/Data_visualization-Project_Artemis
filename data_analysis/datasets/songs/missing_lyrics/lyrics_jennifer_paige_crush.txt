Ah
Crush
Ah

See you blowing me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on, baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it, baby (baby)

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss
And get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do
I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just (ahh) a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (ahh) some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do
Depends on you

Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la

It's raising my adrenaline
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it, baby (baby)
Say that we're forevermore
That's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is maybe (maybe)

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss
And get crazy over you and me
(Crazy over you and me)
Here's what I do
I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny
Oh ohhh

It's just (ahh) a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (ahh) some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do
Depends on you

Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la

Vanilla skies
(Vanilla skies)
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me
(And me, and me, and me)

It's just (ahh) a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (ahh) some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do
Depends on you

Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la

Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do
