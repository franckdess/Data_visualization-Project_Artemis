Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Better enjoy yourself
Better enjoy yourself
You sittin' over there starin' in space a-while
People are dancin', dancin' all over the place
But you shouldn't worry about things that cha can't control
A-come on girl while the night is young
Why don't she let, let yourself go woo
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Better enjoy yourself
Better enjoy yourself
Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time you an' me
Sittin' there wit-cha mouth poked out
Just as sweet as you can be
Why don't-cha live, live the life you got
Come on girl let's git it while the music's runnin' hot woo
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Better enjoy yourself
Better enjoy yourself
Pretty girl I been watching you
I can wipe away that frown
Ah you an' I should git together
We could tear the house down
We could tear the house down
We could tear the whole house down woo
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Better enjoy yourself
Better enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself
Git down, git down
Enjoy yourself
Come on, come on, come on, come on
(Come on, come on, come on
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it, you can do it)
Woo
