When I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Ooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would've known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
You got to hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
Oh, you got to hold on
Hold on to your love, ooh

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's 'bout good love you make
When his heart's on fire
Give him love every day
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
You got to hold on, hey
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on to your love, yeah, hey
Hold on to your love
Oh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
Baby, hold on

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Oh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair

Hold on to your love
You got to hold on
Hold on to your love
DonÂ´t let go
Keep the ties
Hold on to your love
Hang on tight, and don't let go
Hold on to your love, ooh
Don't let go
Hold on to your love
Hold on to your love, ooh

(Hold on to your love)
If you love him, if you need him, really want him
(Hold on to your love, ooh)
Just keep on, just keep on hanging on (Hold on)
Little trust, honesty, golden rule (Hold on)
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep (Hold on)
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home (Hold on)
Hey, yeah
He'll come home to you (Hold on)
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you (Hold on)
The time, oh (Hold on)
Have a little faith, don't be so blinded... (Hold on)
