{Intro}
Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town, Lido put the money down and let it roll
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road
Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun, until he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow, and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline, headin' for the borderline
Goin' for broke
Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint ain't nothin to it
One more for the road
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
One more job ought to get it
One last shot and we quit it
One more for the road
{Bridge}
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh...
