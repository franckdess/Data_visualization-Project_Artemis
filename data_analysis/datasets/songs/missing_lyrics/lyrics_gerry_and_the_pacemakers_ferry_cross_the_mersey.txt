Life goes on day after day
Hearts torn in every way
So ferry 'cross the Mersey
Cause this land's the place I love
And here I'll stay
People they rush everywhere
Each with their own secret care
So ferry 'cross the Mersey
And always take me there
The place I love
People around every corner
They seem to smile and say
We don't care what your name is boy
We'll never turn you away
So I'll continue to say
Here I always will stay
So ferry 'cross the Mersey
Cause this land's the place I love
And here I'll stay
And here I'll stay
Here I'll stay
