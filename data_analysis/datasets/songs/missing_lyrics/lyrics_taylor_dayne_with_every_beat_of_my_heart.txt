I keep getting closer
To the love I know
I'm ready and willing
Getting out of control
You win and you lose some
But if you stay in the game
Before you know it
You'll feel the fire
But don't get burned by the flame
You'll find the answer any day
With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know we're getting closer
To love with every beat
I just wanna know you
More every day
And now it won't be long
Till I hear you say (say it, say it)
Say that you do boy
It's just a matter of time
Before you know it
You'll feel the fire
And it's burning deep inside
You'll find the answer
In his eyes
With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know we're getting closer to love
With every beat of my heart
I feel you moving closer to me, oh
With every beat of my heart
Baby I know it's becoming reality
With every beat
