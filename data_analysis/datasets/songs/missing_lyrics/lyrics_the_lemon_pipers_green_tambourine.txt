Drop your silver in my tambourine
Help a poor man fill a pretty dream
Give me pennies, I'll take anything
Now listen while I play-play-play-play-play
My green tambourine
Watch the jingle jangle start to shine
Reflections of the music that is mine
When you toss a coin, you'll hear it sing
Now listen while I play-play-play-play-play
My green tambourine
Drop a dime before I walk away
Any song you want, I'll gladly play
Money feeds my music machine
Now listen while I play-play-play-play-play
My green tambourine
Listen and I'll play-play-play-play-play
