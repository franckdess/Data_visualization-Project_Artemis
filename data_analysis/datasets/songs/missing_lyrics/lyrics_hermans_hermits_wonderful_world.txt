I don't know much about my history, now
Don't know much about biology
Don't know much about the science book, now
Don't know much about the French I took
All I do know is I love you, now
And I wonder if you love me too
Ooh, what a wonderful world this could be
Ooh, I don't know much about geography, now
Don't know much about trigonometry, now
Don't know much about the algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two, now
And I wonder if you love me too
Ooh, what a wonderful world this could be
I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But that's what I'm trying to be
But by being an 'A' student, baby
Look like I could win your love for me
Don't know much about the history, now, oh now
Don't know much about biology
I don't know much about the science book, now
Don't know much about the good French I took, oh
All I do know is I love you, now, oh now
And I wonder if you love me too
Ooh, what a wonderful world this could be
Good Lord, I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But that's what I'm trying to be, oh now
But if I have to be an 'A' student, baby
I'm gonna win your love for me
I don't know much about geography, now, oh now
Don't know much about trigonometry
Don't know much about the algebra, now
Don't know what a good slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two, now, oh now
And I wonder if you love me too
Ooh, what a wonderful world this could be
Oh, my, my good Lord, I've been trying
I've been trying, I've been trying, oh Lord
To understand the thing
That I've been looking for
