Saw you walkin' out on Sentimental Street
What'cha doin' out there
Who you tryin' to be
I know what you're thinking
'Cause I've been there myself
I've been kicked so many times
I don't know nothin' else
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the flair
That ya got from chasin'
All those east coast dares
And I've seen it before
It happens time and again
All cut up inside
Yet you're caught in a spin
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you dancin' out at Madame Wong Two's
You did the same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Caf√©
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're having too much fun
With your sudden romance
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Oh' take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you walking out on Sentimental Street
What'cha doin' out there
Who you tryin' to be
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you
