I do swear that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment, life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment, I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on
Ohh

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment

I will love you (I will love you), as long as I live
From this moment on (On)
Mmm, mmm
