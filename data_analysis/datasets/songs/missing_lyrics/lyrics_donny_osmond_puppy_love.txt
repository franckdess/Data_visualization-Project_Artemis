And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How the young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all
Please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll be back (you’ll be back)
In my arms once again (You’ll be back in my arms once again)

Someone help me
Help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love
Someone help me
Help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love
Not a puppy love
