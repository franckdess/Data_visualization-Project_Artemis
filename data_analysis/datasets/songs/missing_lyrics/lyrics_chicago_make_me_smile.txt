Children play in the park
They don't know
I'm alone in the dark
Even though
Time and time again
I see your face smiling inside
I'm so happy (Oho)
That you love me (Oho, yeah)
Life is lovely (Oh)
When you're near me
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile
Living life is just a game
So they say
All the games we used to play
Fade away
We may now enjoy
The dreams we shared so long ago
Oh, my darling (Oho)
Got to have you (Yeah, yeah)
Feel the magic (Ooohooo!)
When I hold you
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky
Now I need you (Oh, yeah)
More than ever (Oh, yeah)
No more crying (Ooohooo)
We're together
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile
