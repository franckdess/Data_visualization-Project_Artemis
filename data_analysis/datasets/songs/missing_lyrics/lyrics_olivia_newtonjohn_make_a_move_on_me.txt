I can tell you got plans for me
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully
But tonight
I have to say
There just might be another way
(I can't wait to)
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms?
I can't wait
I can't wait

I'm the one you want
That's all I wanna be
So come on baby, make a move on me
Got nowhere to go
All my time is free
So come on baby, make a move on me
Tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait

You made the prettiest speech I've heard
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words
To a heart that's open wide
And from the start was on your side
(I can't wait to)
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms?
I can't wait
I can't wait

I'm the one you want
That's all I wanna be
So come on baby, make a move on me
Got nowhere to go
All my time is free
So come on baby, make a move on me
Tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait

I'm the one you want
That's all I wanna be
So come on baby, make a move on me
Got nowhere to go
All my time is free
So come on baby, make a move on me
Tonight
I can't wait
I can't wait
