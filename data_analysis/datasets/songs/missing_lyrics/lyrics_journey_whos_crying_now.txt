It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder, who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die
Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh
Ooooooh-whoa, ooh-whooa

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who will be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now
