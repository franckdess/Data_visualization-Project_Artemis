I don't know but I think I may be fallin' for you
Dropping so quickly
Maybe I should keep this to myself
Wait until I know you better

I'm trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

As I'm standing here
And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance
All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

I'm trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

Oh, I just can't take it
My heart is racing
The emotions keep spilling out

I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking 'bout it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
Oh, oh, no, no
Oh, oh, I'm fallin' for you
