Ooh
Something's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a love on fire
Hold me tight baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
It surrounds me
Moving like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things I do for you
Blow my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
Baby, how you do it
There must be something to it
Babe now it's gotta be love
The magic's in your hand
You made me understand
I know, I know it's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
(Love) and my life's looking up (love)
