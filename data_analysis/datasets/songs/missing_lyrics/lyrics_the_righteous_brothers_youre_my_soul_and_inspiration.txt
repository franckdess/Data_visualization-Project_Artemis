Girl, I can't let you do this
Let you walk away
Girl, how can I live through this?
When you're all I wake up for each day baby
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby what good am I?
I never had much going
But at least I had you
How can you walk out knowing
I ain't got nothing left if you do, baby
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby what good am I?
Oh, what good am I?
Baby, I can't make it without you
And I'm, I'm telling you honey
You're my reason for laughing, for crying
For living and for dying
Baby, I can't make it without you
Please, I'm begging you baby
If you go it will kill me, I swear it
Girl, I just can't bear it
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby what good am I?
What good am I?
Mmm
Ooh
