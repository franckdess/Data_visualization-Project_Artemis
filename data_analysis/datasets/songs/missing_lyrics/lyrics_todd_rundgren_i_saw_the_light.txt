It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you
So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you

Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)

Though we had our fling (we had our fling)
I just never would suspect a thing (suspect a thing)
'Til that little bell began to ring (began to ring)
In my head, in my head
But I tried to run (I tried to run)
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none (would not help me none)
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said

But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)


But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes

And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes (in my eyes)

In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
In my eyes (in my eyes)
