Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be
I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

You say your faith is shaken
And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting near, I don't care where I have to run

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
Oh yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me
Oh yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back...(fade)
