Shoo doo doo wop! 4x

You never have to worry about my love
As long as you're taking care of business
With my heart
See, I'm a kind of girl
To dedicate my world
And you gotta give me all you got
I need it all, baby
Every drop

You got to show me
And mean the words you say
It's not a game for me, baby
It's just not that way

I'm only one woman, baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman, baby
And I need a one woman man
Shoo doo doo wop! 7x

You never have to wonder if I care
If you're sharing the way
I feel for love you know I'm real
I'm the kind of girl
To dedicate my world
But you gotta give me all you got
I need it all, baby
Every drop
You got to show me
And mean the words you say
It's not a game for me, baby
It's just not that way
You got to show me
And mean the words you say
It's not a game for me, baby
It's just not that way
I'm only one woman, baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman, baby
And I need a one woman man
I'm only one woman, baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman, baby
And I need a one woman man
I'm only one woman, baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman, baby
And I need a one woman man
I'm only one woman, baby
Treat me like a lady
You gotta take the time to show me
That I'm your one and only
I'm only one woman, baby
And I need a one woman man
