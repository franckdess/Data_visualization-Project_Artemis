Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it
Never gonna lose it
I can't refuse it
Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
Well, I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it out to Needles
Can you feel it?
Must be near it
Feels so good
Oh, it feels so good
Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Oh, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma, not Arizona
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
Oh, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it
Never gonna lose it
I can't refuse it, oh, oh
Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Well, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember
In Oklahoma, not Arizona
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
