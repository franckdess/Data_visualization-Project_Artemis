Have I a hope for half a chance
To even ask if I could dance with you
Yoo-hoo?
Would you greet me or politely turn away?
Would there suddenly be sunshine
On a cold and rainy day?
Oh, babe, what would you say?
For there are you, sweet lollipop
Here am I
With such a lot to say, hey, hey
Just to walk with you along the Milky Way
To caress you through the nighttime
Bring you flowers every day
Oh, babe, what would you say?
'Cause oh, baby, I know
I know I could be so in love with you
And I know that I could make you love me, too
And if I could only hear you say you do
Oo-oo-oo-oo
But, anyway, what would you say?
Yes, oh, baby
I know
I know I could be so in love with you
And I know that I could make you love me, too
And if I could only hear you say you do
Oo-oo-oo-oo
But, anyway
What would you say?
