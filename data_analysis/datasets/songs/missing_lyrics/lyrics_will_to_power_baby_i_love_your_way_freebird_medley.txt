Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love
Your love won't wait, oh no no
(Ooh)
Baby, I love your way every day
(Ooh)
Wanna tell you I love your way every day
(Ooh)
Wanna be with you night and day
Hey, I love your way
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on now
There's so many places I've gotta see
But if I stayed here with you girl
Things just wouldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird will never change
And this bird will never change
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pines
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love
Your love won't wait
Ooh, baby
I love your way
(Every day)
(Ooh)
Wanna tell you I love your way
(Night and day)
Oh, baby, I love your way
(Every day)
Every day now
Ooh wanna tell you I love your way
(Night and day, night and day)
I love your way
Ooh, baby
I love your way
('Cause I'm as free as a bird now)
Give me you way
Wanna tell you I love your way
(A free bird now)
Ooh baby I love your ways
Ooh, baby I love your way
(Every day)
Ooh, wanna tell you I love your way
(Night and day)
Ooh, baby I love your way
(Every day, every day)
Ooh, wanna tell you I love your way
(Night and day, night and day, oh)
Ooh, baby I love your way
(Night and day)
