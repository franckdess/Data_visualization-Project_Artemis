Uh.. uh uh uh uh
Uh.. wait a minute now
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Uh, uh..
Can you hear me out there?
Lunatics.. is y'all ready?
Let me hear ya
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

I'm a sucker for corn rows and manicured toes (hey)
Fendi capri pants and Parasuco's (alright)
The rise of Diddy and City, with one or two throws
I'm draftin' 'em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows? I know and I love it when you make your knees
Touch your elbows and break it down low to the Flo'
And there you go now throw it on me slow
And everytime I bust a rhyme, baby, "Gimme Some Mo'"
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind and I'll be
Right back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it
Time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, "Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?"
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

We can gamble to the break of dawn, nigga, money long, nigga
Pass up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga
Some say I'm wrong, but fuck it I'm grown, nigga
If you ain't 'bout money then best be gone, nigga
I'm flashy (uh), double takes when you walk past me
Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me
I drive fastly, call me Jeff Gord-on in the Black SS with the naviga-tion
See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an
Another one page-in, tellin' me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

Ayo, I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin' icky. Let
Go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin' when the shows out, whatchu mean?!
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut, come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut, is you wit me?
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies. If
You compare me to your local grocery, then
You'll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G, then bag and scan me
Sure like Al B., meet the 'tics in Maui, hey

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

St. Louis y'all, uh, uh
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Uh, can you feel that?
Lunatics y'all, uh, uh
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Uh, uh, Uncle Phil up above y'all, uh, uh
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yell it universal y'all, uh, uh
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Uh, uh, chillin' chillin' chillin' with the crew y'all

Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night
