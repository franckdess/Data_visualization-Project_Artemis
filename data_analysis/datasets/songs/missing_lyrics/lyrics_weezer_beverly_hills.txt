Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme) Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme) Livin' in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme) Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme) Livin' in Beverly Hills


The truth is
I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong

No I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme) Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme) Livin' in Beverly Hills

Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, livin' in Beverly Hills
