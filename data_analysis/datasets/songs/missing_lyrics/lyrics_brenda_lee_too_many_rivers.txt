I wish I could come back to you, dear
'Cause I know that you want me to
But too much water run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross, dear
Too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights
That I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
Now don't think for a moment, I blame only you
We both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces you can't find
Yes, there's too many rivers to cross, dear
And there's too many dreams that have been lost
Oh there's too many long nights
That I've turned and I've tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
