You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world (Baby, you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last (Baby, you know I'm worth it)

Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough, but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)

Mmm hmm, mmm, hmm
Mmm hmm, mmm, hmm
Mmm, mm (Hold up)

If you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should (Baby, I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough ('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

She walks the mile, makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

Ohh, 'cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

No need to read between the lines, spelled out for you (Spelled out for you)
Just hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value (Better value)
A woman's (Woman's) (Sing it) woman's (Woman's) worth

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (Nothing like a woman's worth)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Oh-ooh)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (Comes first)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (Woman's worth)
