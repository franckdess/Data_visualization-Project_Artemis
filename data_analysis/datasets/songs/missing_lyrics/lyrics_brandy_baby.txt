Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time

I guess it's time to say, baby, baby
How you make me feel when you come to my mind
I can't keep my cool, baby, baby
I can't hold it inside

I can't wait each day just to see you walk
Trying to move in close to get to where you are
I'm not trying to be rude, baby, baby
Nothing ventured nothing gained, so I'm telling you

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time

Words just ain't enough, baby, baby
But that's all I can use to state my intentions
Hope it gets to love, baby, baby
It's a perfect situation

Cause we fit together like a hand in glove
Just to be with you is all I'm thinkin' of
What else can I say, baby, oh, baby
We are alone, and I'm singing this song to you

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time

My darling, oh baby
You're all I'm thinking of now
My darling, oh baby
You're all I need right now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine (You're on my mind)
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time (Thinking about you all the time)

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Think about you all the time
