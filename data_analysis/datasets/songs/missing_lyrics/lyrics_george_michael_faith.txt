Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta' think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door
'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith
Baby I know you're askin' me to stay
Say "Please, please, please don't go away"
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more
Yes I gotta' have faith
Ooh, I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith
I gotta' have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for somethin' more
'Cause I gotta' have faith
Ooh, I gotta' have faith
Because I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
I gotta' have faith, faith, faith
