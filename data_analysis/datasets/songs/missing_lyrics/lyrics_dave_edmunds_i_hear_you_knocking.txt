You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knockin' on my door

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
And now you're tellin' me all your lies

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been
Ah, yes
Ooh-hoo, ooh
Child, rave it up
Fats Domino
Smiley Lewis
Chuck Berry
Huey Smith, oh
Let's do it

You better get back to your used-to-be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been

I told you way back in '52
That I would never go with you

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you been
Yes
Ooh-hoo, ooh
Yes
That's a gal of gal
Ah, yes
