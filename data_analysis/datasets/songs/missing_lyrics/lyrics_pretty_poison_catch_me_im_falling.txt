Are you ready, boy?
Here I come
Catch me
I'm falling

You came into my life
The look in your eyes took me by surprise
It's you and nobody else
Your love has made me so blind
I can't see
I am descending
From heaven above
So catch me
I'm falling, baby
Hold onto my love

Catch me
I'm falling
Catch me now
I'm falling
Catch me
I'm falling
Catch me now
I'm falling
Falling in love

Two hearts beating in time
The rhythm as one
I am yours
You are mine
For you
I surrender myself
Each night
Every day
Always feeling this way
Falling in motion
As though I had wings
Your sweet love and devotion
Baby, it's magic
A magical thing


Ooooh, baby
What can I do?
I'm falling for you
