This is insane
All you did was say hello
Speak my name
Feeling your love
Like a love I used to know
Long ago

How can it be?
We're a different space in time
Come to me
Feel Like I'm home in a place I used to know
Long Ago

Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Déjà Vu

This is divine
I've been waiting all my life
Filling time
Looking for you
That's worth more than you could know
Long Ago

Come to me now
We don't have to dream of love
We know how
Somewhere before it's as if I loved you so
So long ago

Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Déjà Vu


Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Déjà Vu
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Déjà Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
