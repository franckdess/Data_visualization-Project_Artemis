(Barbara Mason)
 (Are you ready?)
 
 (Are you ready?)
 
I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
But I'm ready  to learn (to learn)
Yes, I'm ready  to learn (to learn)
To fall in love, to fall in love, to fall in love with you
I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
But I'm ready  to learn (to learn)
Yes, I'm ready  to learn (to learn)
To hold your hand, to make you understand
To hold your hand right now
I don't even know how to kiss your lips (kiss your lips)
At a moment like this
But I'm going to learn how to do
All the things you want me to
(Are you ready?) Yes, I'm ready
(Are you ready?) Yes, I'm ready
To fall in love, to fall in love, to fall in love right now
(Are you ready?) Yes, I'm ready
(Are you ready?) Yes, I'm ready
(To kiss me?) Yes, I'm ready
(To love me?)
To kiss you, love you, and hug you
Baby, I'm ready
