We were very happy
Well, at least I thought we were
Can't somebody tell me what's got into her
A house, a home, a family
And a man that loves her so
Who'd believe she'd leave us
To join the burlesque show
Oh, say has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose
Here's her picture when she was my sweet Mary Jo
Now she's got rings on her fingers
And bells on her toes
Say has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose
Oh, I got wind my Jo's been dancing here in New Orleans
In this smoke-filled honky-tonk
They call the land of dreams
Oh, here she comes a strutting in her birthday clothes
Say has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose
Oh baby, baby, won't you come home
Say we all miss you
And every night we kiss your picture
Oh Rose, one night
The lights go dim and the crowd goes home
That's the day you wake up and you find you're all alone
So let's say good-bye to Gypsy, hello Mary Jo
Say has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose
So take those rings off your fingers
And bells off your toes
Say has anybody seen my
Now you know just what I mean by
Has anybody seen my Gypsy Rose
