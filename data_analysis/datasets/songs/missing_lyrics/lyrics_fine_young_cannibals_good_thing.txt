The one good thing in my life
Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I cannot follow her
The one good thing didn't stay too long
My back was turned and she was gone

Good thing
Where have you gone?
My good thing
You've been gone too long

People say I should forget
There's plenty more, don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime
That's not what I want to hear
I want to hear she wants me near

Good thing
Where have you gone?
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing


Then one day, she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room
Caught me dreaming like a fool

Good thing, my good thing
My good thing, where have you gone
My good thing, my good thing
Where have you gone
It's been so long
Good God, girl
Good God, girl
Good God, girl
Good God
