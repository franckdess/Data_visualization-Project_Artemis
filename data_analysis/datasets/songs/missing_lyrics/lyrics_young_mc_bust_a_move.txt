Bust it

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya overzealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move
Just bust a move
Just bust a move
Just bust a move

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow"
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it, yeah

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way"
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it

Break it down for me fellas

Your best friend Harry, has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say, "neat-o", check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really firm cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', faces pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, so you bust a move

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (move it boy)
Yeah
