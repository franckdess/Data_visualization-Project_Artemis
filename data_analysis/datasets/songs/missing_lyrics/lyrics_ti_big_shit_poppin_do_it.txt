Hey, hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, do it, do it—what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
What you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Do it to the maximum, take it while you askin' them
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational
See, I said I was King, and them lames started laughin', them
Same suckers now want the King on a track with 'em
I composed several classicals, you know, like "Top Back"
"Dope Boyz", "Bring 'Em Out"
And "What You Know About That"
Now they ask how I top "What You Know About That"
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back
See me reign hell, I just showed you like that
Even Denzel say, "Damn, I ain't know it like that!"
Nigga, yeah, still Bankhead, you can tell
Ain't nothin' changed but the name on the mail
I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in the chair
I will slang 'caine, no such thing as a jail
Say you need a hundred squares? It just came off the scale

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Do it like a ball player where you see me ball at
Stacks tall as ball players from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati, or the Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pullin' out that pistol, nigga, who you think you finna scare?
These 20 rounds of missiles have ya pissin' in your underwear
I tote a pair of .40 cal's, so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it goin' down
A-Town, West Side, club crucial, catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro, and Mack be
Jackers lie, say they caught me slippin', how could that be?
I'm somethin' like a stalker, I be e'rywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumpin' with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it, nigga, I could get a hundred on the tab
Sell 'em all, double down, nigga, do the math
Think I won't pull up in somethin' with 200 on the dash?

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Now, I do it like I wanna do it, and do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimpin', I ain't seein' none of you
I do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his mama too
I do it for my oldest sons and their grandmama too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it ain't a problem to
You do somethin' to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers
Ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
We do it for the block, that's why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it did good and do it did fresh
No matter what I do, you know I do it to death

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, ‘cause I'ma do it, ‘cause I'ma do it
Hey, what you waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey what you waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Let me hear you say big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and lil' shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas
Bein' broke is not an option, now do it!
