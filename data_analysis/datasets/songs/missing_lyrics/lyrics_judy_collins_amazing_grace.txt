Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now can see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead us home
And when we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We'll have no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now can see
