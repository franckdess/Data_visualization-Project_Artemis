Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go

Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
How I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me

Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long

My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait

Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back

Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are
I love you

All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go
Not able to let go
No, I won't let you go, no

I don't know what else to say
No, no, no, no
