{Intro}

People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)

Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)
(Outside) I'm masquerading
(Inside) my hope is fading
Just a clown, oh yeah, since you put me down
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you
Baby, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, just look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Take a good look at my face
Ooh yeah, you'll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
