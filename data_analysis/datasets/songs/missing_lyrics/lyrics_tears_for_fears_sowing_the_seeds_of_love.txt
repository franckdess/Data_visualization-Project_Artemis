High time we made a stand
And shook up the views of the common man
And the love train rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracy?
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues, yeah, yeah

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Anything is possible when you're sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love
Anything is possible
Seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds

I spy tears in their eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician granny with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the majority feels?
So without love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of a government plan
Kick out the style, bring back the jam

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Anything
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds

The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me
In love


Feel the pain, talk about it
If you're a worried man, then shout about it
Open hearts, feel about it
Open minds, think about it
Everyone, read about it
Everyone, scream about it
Everyone
Everyone, yeah, yeah
Everyone read about it, read about it
Everyone
Read it in the books, in the crannies and the nooks, there are books to read for us

Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
We're sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love
We're sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Mr. England sowing the seeds of love

Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes

High time we made a stand
Time to eat all your words
And shook up the views of the common man
Swallow your pride
And the love train rides from coast to coast
Open your eyes
Every minute of every hour
I love a sunflower
Open your eyes
And I believe in love power
Open your eyes
Love power
Love power
Open your eyes

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds

An end to need
And the politics of greed
With love

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Anything, anything
Sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds

An end to need
And the politics of greed
With love

Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
