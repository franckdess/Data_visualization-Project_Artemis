Everytime I think of you it always turns out good
Everytime I've held you I thought you understood
People say a love like ours will surely pass
But I know a love like ours will last and last
But maybe I was wrong not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And everytime I think of you (Everytime)
Everytime I think of you (Every single time)
It always turns out good
Seasons come and seasons go but our love will never die
Let me hold you, darlin', so you won't cry
'Cause people say that our love affair will never last
But we know a love like ours will never pass
But maybe I was wrong not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And everytime I think of you (Everytime)
Everytime I think of you (Every single time)
It always turns out good
People say a love like ours will surely pass
But I know a love like ours will last and last
But maybe I was wrong not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong in knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
It always turns out good
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
Everytime I think of you
