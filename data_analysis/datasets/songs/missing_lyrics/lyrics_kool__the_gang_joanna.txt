Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me
I'm in love, and I won't lie
She's my girl and always on my mind
She gives me her love and a feeling that's right
Never lets me down, especially at night
So, I'm gonna do the best I can
To please that girl and be her only man, see
She picks me up when I'm feelin low
And that's why baby I've got to let you know
Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me, my baby
She's the one, the one for me
She's the kind of girl makes you feel nice, so
I'll try my best to do what's right
Take her for a ride, everything's fine
Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me
Searched so far, searched so long
To find someone, someone to count on
Now I feel I've got it right here
Found it in you, baby, you, my dear
We can do all night, so nice
We'll have it all and everything will be alright
I'm promising you, take it from me
Take it home, baby take it home, baby
She's the one, the one for me
She's the kind of girl makes you feel nice, so
I'll try my best to do what's right
Take her for a ride, everything's fine
Oh Joanna
Oh Joanna
Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me
Joanna, yes I love you, I love you
You're the one, the one for me
Believe me babe
