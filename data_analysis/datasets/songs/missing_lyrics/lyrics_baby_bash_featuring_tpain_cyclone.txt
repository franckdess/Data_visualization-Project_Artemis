Oh, oh oh
Swa-na-na-na-na
The mighty cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

Now look at that dumper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even playing when she shaking that rumpa
And, oh, you ain't know? She get lower than a muffler
Either with her girlfriends or showstoppin' with her hustler
The way she move her body, she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

It's a rap when she breakin' boys off the typhoon (It's a rap)
Gotta get that feta like a boss tycoon (It's a rap)
Now hold it steady, cause she make a monsoon (It's a rap)
Now you can Google, download to iTunes
See, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin'
Bet she got them heads turnin'
You gon' hear it clack-clack when them heels get to burnin'
Stiletto so fuego, she got her own label
And got us all doin' her tomato

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
The mighty cyclone

Going hard when they turn the spotlights on

Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
