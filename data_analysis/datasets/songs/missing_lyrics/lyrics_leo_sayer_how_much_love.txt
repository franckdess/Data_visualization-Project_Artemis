How much love do you need
Before you give your love to me
How much time before it grows
How much love I wanna know
What can I do what can I say
The last thing I want is to drive you away
How much love does it take
How much love for heaven sake
How much love how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love how much love how much love
Am I tryin' too hard
Give me some kind of clue
There must be a way to get through to you
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate
Do I rush right in or do I wait
How much love how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love how much love how much love
I got so much love
Don't know where to begin
I'm pleadin' with you babe
You gotta let me in
