Cab fare to nowhere
Is what you are
A white line to an exit sign
Is what you are
Oh, but I saw in you
Now I see through
Don't shed a tear for me
My life won't end without you
Long as the night will be
The sun will rise without you
A locked door on a candy store
Is what you are
A slim chance in tight pants
Is what you are
All that I loved you for
I want it more
Don't shed a tear for me
My life won't end without you
Long as the night will be
The sun will rise without you
You ain't giving
What I'm not taking
I'm not missing
What we ain't making
Oh but I saw in you
Now I see through
Don't shed a tear for me
My life won't end without you
Long as the night will be
The sun will rise without you
Don't shed a tear for me
My life won't end without you
Long as the night will be
The sun will rise without you
Don't, don't shed no tears
I don't need, I don't need
I don't need a thing
I don't need no more crocodile tears
So strong I am now
I'll be alright
I'm a pawn for you girl
There won't be a game
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha
I feel it baby
I don't need any crocodile tears
As long as the night, baby
You've got to have a limelight
I won't shed a tear darlin'
I won't shed a tear baby
I won't shed a tear, all right
Don't cry for me
Don't cry for me
Don't cry for me, girl
