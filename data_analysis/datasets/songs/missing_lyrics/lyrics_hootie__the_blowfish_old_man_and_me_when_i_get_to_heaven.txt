Well an old man said to me in a voice filled with pain
"Where you going young man?"
Said "I'm going to fight a war
Gonna fight for my country in some foreign land"
He said "The sun will never hurt you, never harmed anyone
But you must realize
If you try to stare her down, she will win in the end
She will burn your eyes"
She will burn them
Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven
He said "Boy I was young once, yeah, I was tough
Sailing on Uncle Sam's boat
Hey I could kill the enemy; I could die on foreign streets
But I could not vote
But now you walk by me; you won't talk to me
Say this is my fate
But every time you walk the streets boy
Most of them you meet
You see, it's you they hate
It's you they hate
Seen a million faces
Seen a million places die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven
I hope I get there
Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get there
See this woman sitting next to me
She's been there for a long, long time
And when I fell, she picked me up
And when I cried, she wiped my tears
I thank god she's mine
And when I leave this world
She won't have anything but her love for me
'Cause the man took everything else and made me hate myself
So just let her be boy
Won't you let her be
Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
Seen a million mothers die
Seen a million brothers die
But I wonder who will walk with me
When I get there
When I get to Heaven
I hope I get there
When I get to Heaven, yeah...
