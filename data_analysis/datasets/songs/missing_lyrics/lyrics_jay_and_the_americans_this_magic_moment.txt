This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes
Sweeter than wine (sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night (softer than a summer night)
Everything I want, I have (everything, everything)
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment (this magic moment)
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time
(this magic moment)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(this magic moment)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Sweeter than wine (sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night (softer than a summer night)
Everything I want, I have (everything, everything)
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment (this magic moment)
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever (this magic moment)
Forever till the end of time (magic)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (moment)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (magic)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (moment)
Magic, oh-oh-oh
Magic, oh-oh-oh
Magic, oh-oh-oh (moment)
