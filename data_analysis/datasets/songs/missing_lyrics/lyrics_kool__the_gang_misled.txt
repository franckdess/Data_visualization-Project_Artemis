Late at night, body's yearning
Restless night, wanna be with you
Someone's playing in the garden
So enticing, should I take a bite?
I don't know what's come over me, yeah
She's as heavy as a Chevy
Pure excitement, misled
When she touches, can't resist her
I'm a puppet when she's playing
She's outgoing but I love her so
Misled
So I'm saying now
Baby baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place wanna take me to
Tell me what's the price if I go with you
My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
The thrill, then I will
Hey misled, be for real
Thought I knew her, this lady
Opportunist, misled
Always searching for adventure
Like Pandora's box, misled
And I don't know what I'm gonna do without her
Woohoo, baby baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place wanna take me to
Tell me what's the price if I go with you
My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
The thrill, then I will
Hey misled, won't you be for real
I've got this feeling that it's rocking my way
But I love her just the same, just the same
Oh yes, I do, yeah
Misled, heard you call my name
Misled, what's your claim to fame?
Misled, took me by the hand
Misled, said I would understand
Misled, built a bomb of broken dreams
Misled, not a pretty scene
Misled, baby, that's your name
Misled, what's your claim to fame?
My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
The thrill, then I will
Misled, won't you be for real
Baby, baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place you wanna take me to
Tell me what's the price If I go with you
My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill, then I will
Hey misled, won't you be for real
Misled, misled
Misled
Misled, misled
Misled
(Hee-hee, ooh)
Misled, misled
Misled
(Mmm, I was misled by you)
Misled, misled
Misled
(Hee-hee, ooh)
Misled, misled
Misled
(I was misled by you)
Misled, misled
Misled
(Do it again)
