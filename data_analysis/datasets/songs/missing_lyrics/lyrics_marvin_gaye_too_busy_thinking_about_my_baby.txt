Ah-ah-aaah, oh yeah
Oh listen to me people

I haven't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I haven't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly
And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow

Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

Said, I haven't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's going to last
And I haven't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class
Telling you I'm just a fellow
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell you
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

(Yeah, she's never hard to find
Because she's always on my mind)
