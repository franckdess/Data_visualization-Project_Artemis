Ooh, yeah
Ooh, it must be magic
How inside your eyes I feel my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall, they'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven and you would take their place
Then I saw red when I opened up the door
I saw red, my heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Ooh, yeah
Every day I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to it
So many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles and make everything alright
I saw red when I opened up the door
I saw red, my heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Oh, I've been hurt, I've been blind
I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way, yeah
I saw red when I opened up the door
I saw red, my heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face, oh
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Ooh, it must be magic
