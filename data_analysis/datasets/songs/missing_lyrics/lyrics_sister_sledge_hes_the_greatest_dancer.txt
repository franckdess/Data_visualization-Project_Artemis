Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't caring but I felt my eyes staring
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit, as a man he is complete
My crème de la crème, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Oooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
