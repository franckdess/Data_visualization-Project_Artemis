When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive
(Oh!)

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)


And I would've walked head-on into the deep end of the river
Clingin' to your stocks and bonds
Payin' your H.P. demands forever
They're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength, and run the field you play alone

Someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
(Sugar bear, sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear?
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight
(Someone saved my life tonight)
