Love, love, devotion, devotion
Feeling, feeling, emotion, emotion
Don't be afraid to be weak
Don't be too proud to be strong
Just look into your heart, my friend
That will be the return to yourself
The return to innocence


The return to innocence

If you want, then start to laugh
If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself, don't hide
Just believe in destiny
Don't care what people say
Just follow your own way
Don't give up and use the chance
To return to innocence


That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence


That's the return to innocence
