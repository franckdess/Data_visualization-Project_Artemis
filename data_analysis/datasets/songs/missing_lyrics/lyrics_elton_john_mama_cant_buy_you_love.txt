Baby, so they give you anythin'
Darlin', all the joy money can bring
Baby, do they bring you happiness
Darlin', you're no different from the rest

Can't you see that it's love you really need
Take my hand, and I'll show what a love could be
Before it's too late

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Baby, fancy friends show you a smile
Darlin', rich relations for a while
Baby, I can only give you love
Darlin', a-this old heart should be enough

All I need is a chance to make you mine
Let me in, oh, I'll change the way you feel inside
Before it's too late

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
