Boy
There's no one home tonight
The timing could be right
To forget the rules
We're out of school until tomorrow
Now
If only you would stay
There's so many games we'd play
Why should we pretend
To be just friends
When we could be so much more?

Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)

Words
Don't mean so much to me
I'd rather wait and see
See what happens
When the lights go down
With your arms around me
Time
To leave the world behind
Save it for another time
'Cause I don't remember
Where I am
When you start to love me (love me)


Oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby
Baby love
Oooh, oooh ooh
Sweet and tasty
Baby
Baby love
Oooh, oooh, ooh

Boy
I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide
How we feel
When we are near each other
Undercover
Warm
I hold you close to me
You're perfection
First degree
'Cause I don't remember
Where I am
When you start to move me (move me)
