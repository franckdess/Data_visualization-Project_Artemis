Ooh, how do you like your love?
Ooh, how do you like your love?
But if you want to know
How I really feel
Just get the cameras rollin'
And get the action goin'
Baby you know
My love for you is real
So take me where you want to
Me and my heart you steal
(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?
(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?
(More, more, more) How do you like it? How do you like it?
