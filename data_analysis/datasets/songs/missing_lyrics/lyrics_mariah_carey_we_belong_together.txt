Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ohh oh, ooh, ohh oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe (Come back, come back)
Come back, baby, please (Come back, come back)
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else?)
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else?)
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else?)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
"I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life; We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
And it's still so hard to believe (Come back, come back)
Come back, baby, please (Come back, come back)
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else?)
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else?)
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else?)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby! (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Who else? Who else?) (Together)
It's still so hard to believe (Who else?) (Come back, come back)
Come back, baby, please (Come back, come back)
‘Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else?)
Who’s gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who else?)
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else?)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
(Who else? Who else? Who else? We belong together)
