They be like "Smoove (what?) Can you teach me how to Dougie?"
You know why? Cause all the bitches love me
All I need is a beat that's super-bumpin'
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it
Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie, right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now everybody tryna to do me
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryna to screw me
Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie

The name is Yung for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West but I can teach you how to Dougie
I step up in the club and all these bitches bug me
On a nigga dancin' and none of them know me
I hear this crowd screamin' like, aye get it Brodie
So I'm move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like, how he do that
He can Dougie on the flow
And when that nigga stop they like, Dougie some mo
I'm like, a nigga kinda tired then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew cash

Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryin' to get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home
She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'
