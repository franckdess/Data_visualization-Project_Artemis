I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now, so far away
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay?
Deep in my soul
I feel so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today
So there it is, girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
I know it's late and I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light, come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
