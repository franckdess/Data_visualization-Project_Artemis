(Baby), although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men, big cigars, gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now

Oh, I've been used, ooh, used (ooh used)
I've been a fool, oh, what a fool (oh what a fool)
I broke all the rules, oh, yeah (all the rules)
But I (must let the show go on)

(Baby), there's an enormous crowd of people
They're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls of this theater
Let me out, let me out

Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind (oh so blind)
I wasted time, wasted, wasted, wasted time (wasted time)
Walking on a wire, high wire (high high wire)
But I (must let the show go on)

Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind (oh so blind)
I wasted time, wasted, wasted all too much time (wasted time)
Walking on a wire, high wire (high high wire)
But I (must let the show go on)

Baby, I wish you'd help me escape
Help me get away
(Hoo ooh) Leave me outside my address (hoo ooh)
Far away from this (hoo ooh) masquerade (hoo ooh)

'Cause I've been blind, oh, so blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted all too much time
Walking on a wire, high wire
But I (must let the show go)
I (must let the show go)
I (must let the show go on)
