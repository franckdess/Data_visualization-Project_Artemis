Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Over you
Over you
I want you to want me
I need you so badly I can't think of anything but you--
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head
Day and night, night and day and night, wrong or right
I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright, I need you baby
To warm the lonely night
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh! Pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you...
I want you to want me
I need you so badly, I can't think of anything but you
Goin' out of my head over you (Can't take my eyes off of you)
Out of my head (You're just to good to be true)
Out of my head, day and night, night and day and night, wrong or right
Night and day and night, wrong or right
Night and day and night
And I think I'm goin' out of my... head
