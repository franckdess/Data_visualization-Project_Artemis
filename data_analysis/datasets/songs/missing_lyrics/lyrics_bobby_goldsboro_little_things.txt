Little things that you do
Make me glad I'm in love with you
Little things that you say
Make me glad that I feel this way
The way you smile, the way you hold my hand
And when I'm down you always understand
You know I love those little things I hear
That you say When there's no one near
Little things that you do
Let me know that your love is true
When we walk you like to hold my hand
And when we talk you tell me I'm your man
You know I love those little things that I knew
The little things you whispered in my ear
I know there ain't nobody else like you
No one could do the little things you do
Little things that you do
Make me glad I'm in love with you
Little things that you say
Make me glad that I feel this way
When we walk you like to hold my hand
And when we talk you tell me I'm your man
You know I love those little things that I knew
The little things you whispered in my ear
I know there ain't nobody else like you
