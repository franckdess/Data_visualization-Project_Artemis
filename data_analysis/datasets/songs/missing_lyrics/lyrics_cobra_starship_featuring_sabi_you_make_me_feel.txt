Girl I've been all over the world
Looking for you
I'm known for taking what I think I deserve
And you're overdue
And if you listen you can hear me through the radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missing in my life
What I been dreaming of
You'll be that girl
You'll be that girl
You'll be

Everything you want so let me get up there
I'm the baddest baby in the atmosphere
Tell me what you want so we can do just what you like

You make me feel that
La na na na na
You make me feel so
La na na na na
You make me feel that
La na na na na
You make me feel so
La na na na na
You, you make me feel that

Get a little closer to me girl
And you'll understand
Cause if you want a guy that knows what you need
Well, then I'm your man
And if I listen I can hear you through my radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missing in my life
What I been dreaming of
You'll be that girl
You'll be that girl
You'll be

Everything you want so let me get up there
I'm the baddest baby in the atmosphere
Tell me what you want so we can do just what you like
Ooh
Everything you know I'm flipping upside down
Take you 'round the world
You know I like it loud
Tell me what you want 'cause we can do just what you like

You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You, you make me feel so

You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You, you make me feel so

Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Let the lights drop
Let the lights drop
Make my world stop
Make my world stop
La la la la la
La la la la la

You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You, you make me feel so

You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You, you make me feel so
