Tim and Bob
Bobby Valentino
You know how we do
It's another one

I saw you walking
Down on Melrose
You looked like an angel
Straight out of heaven, girl
I was blown away by
Your sexiness
All I have to do is catch up to you

Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo
Right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me
You'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you
It's so thorough and real

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

So slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Oh baby you know by now that I want you bad
I'm floating on thin air I can't come down
Cupid hit me already damn
Now I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, my hand

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

You, I don't wanna tell you
Oh, looks good, oh, looks good
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Cutie
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
