So tell, baby, tell your true heart
Say what you say when you're all alone
I'm tryin', tryin' to try and feel you
And see if I see I'm feelin' alone
And all I want is to get through
So maybe you'll see that the way you're leaving me, it won't do

It's like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Giving you love that you haven't been given
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you would love me like I
Blowing kisses in the wind, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is, it's like blowing, blowing kisses

So please, baby, please, release me
If time after time your heart's growing cold
I'm sayin' if you don't believe in believing
Ooh ooh, then how can true love ever be so?
And all I want is to get through
So maybe you'll see that the way you're leaving me, it won't do

It's like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Giving you love that you haven't been given
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you would love me like I
Blowing kisses in the wind, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is, it's like blowing, blowing kisses

Like I'm, like blowing kisses, like blowing kisses

And all I want is to get through
So maybe you'll see that the way you're leaving me, it won't do

It's like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Giving you love that you haven't been given
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you would love me like I
Blowing kisses in the wind, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is, it's like blowing kisses
Like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Giving you love that you haven't been given
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm only wishing you would love me like I
Blowing kisses in the wind, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you is, it's like blowing kisses

Like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Like I'm blowing kisses in the wind
Waiting for you is like blowing blowing kisses
