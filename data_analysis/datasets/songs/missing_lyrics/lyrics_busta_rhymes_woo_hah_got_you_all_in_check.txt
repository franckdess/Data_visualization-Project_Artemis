When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check

Busta Rhymes up in the place, true indeed
Yes, I catch wreck and that's word on my seed
I'm guaranteed to give you what you need
One blood everybody like Junior Reid
Wake up every morning, yo I must succeed
Nationwide ruckus make the world stampede
Yo, Willie mek we roll some weed
Mad charged nigga now I must proceed
Yo we 'bout to make moves, set speed
Peace to Baby Phife, Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed
Watch me knock you out like Apollo Creed
Body blows busting your shit, making you bleed
Just feed off dynamic flows and take heed
Need more information, homeboy, then just read
Ay-yah, you can read all about the pure breed
Do the bogle dance, man, do the pepperseed

When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check

Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check

How dare you ever try to step on my suede shoes?
Top Gun shut down your firm like Tom Cruise
Please, let me get down and blow a fuse
Acting fools breaking shit down to molecules
Yo, let me hit you with my ill street blues
Busta Rhymes always headlines the street news
Woo-hah, hey baby girl, don't be confused
Sail my seven seas and enjoy my boat cruise
I know you really want to know who's
Coming through leaving blunt stains and residues
Sorry, homeboy, but your flow sound used
Got to pay your dues, baby, you know the rules
Whenever I travel the world I landcruise
If you choose to fuck around, you get bruised
Now I got you gassed on super unleaded fuels
Give me room, give me some space, yo excuse

When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check

Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check

You now rocking with the best
Busta Rhymes coming through from the Flip Mode Squad
Boy Scout's who I be
Straight to your dome, we coming straight to your dome
Bringing all new ruckus to all you rap motherfuckers
Boy Scout's who I be, Flip Mode is the squ-id-ad
Busta Rhymes break it down like this

Yo, which motherfucker stole my flow?
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Throw them type of niggas right out my window
Blast your ass hit you with a direct blowâ€”bahh
Coming through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars, moving ill like Han Solo
Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine 'cause I got the Hi-Pro Glow
You think that you can hide, you think you can lay low
Roll up on your ass like Hawaii 5-0
Macked out with my dreads and my Kangol
Forget the Moet, nigga, just pass the Cisco
Yo, take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that shit that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through your stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go

When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check
