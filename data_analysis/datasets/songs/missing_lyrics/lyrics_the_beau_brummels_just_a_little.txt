I can't stay, yes I know
You know I hate to go
But goodbye, love was sweet
Our worlds can never meet
So I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go
Away
Can't you see how I feel
When I say love's unreal
So goodbye, it's been sweet
Even though incomplete
So I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go
Away
Every night I still hear
All your sighs very clear
Now love's gone, gone away
As I once heard you say
Now I've cried just a little 'cause I loved you so
And I've died just a little 'cause I had to go
Away
