Yo Vito, you got u one here playa

Step out the Caddy Deville
It's on a base of steel
Them boys checkin' us out
Know when we dress to kill
Struttin' the club
It's dark, but still got my shades on
I hear the DJ mixin' YoungBloodz to that whisper song
We from the city that made it OK to (ay ay ay ay)
To make clubbin' a year-round holiday
So if ya' feelin' right, grab the kryptonite
If this your song tonight, then it's on tonight

Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit It
All my ladies pop ya' backs wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
You know the world be rockin' to it, to it
So do it, do it, do it, to it
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it

Do it, do it, do it, do it
You know the world be rockin' to it, to it
So do it, do it, do it, to it

No need to ask where I'm from, you already know
I represent the "A" from my head to my toes
Step on the dance floor, watch and learn, 'cause here I go
I throw my hands up and work my body to the flow
We from the city that made it OK to (ay ay ay ay)
To make clubbin' a year-round holiday
So if ya feelin' right, grab the kryptonite
