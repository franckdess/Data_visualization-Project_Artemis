And I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school "Goodbye"
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says "How ya feeling hon?"
And I look across at smiling lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not loving me
Then all I've got to say
Oh God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis
In the summertime
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Disneyland Mother Goose
There's no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis
In the summertime
And when my self is feeling low
I think about her face aglow
To ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home
Knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away
And meet me and grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing
And she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently
And smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way
If that ain't loving me
Woah all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis
When the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make-believe
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves
And BB guns
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis
In the summertime
And when my self is feeling low
I think about her face aglow
To ease my mind
