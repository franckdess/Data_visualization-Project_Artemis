Lord, I gotta raise a fuss
Lord, I gotta raise a holler
About workin' all summer
Just to try the earn a dollar
Well, Lord, I tried to call my baby
Try to get a date...
Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertimes blues
Well my mom and papa told me son you gotta make some money
Well if you wanna use the car to go a ridin' next sunday
Oh, Lord, I didn't go to work I told the boss I was sick
Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertimes blues
I gotta take three weeks I gotta have a fine vacation
I gotta take my problems to the United Nations
I done told my congress man and he said quote (dig this boy)
Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertimes blues
Whoa, there ain't no cure
I gotta take three weeks I gotta have a fine vacation
I gotta take my problems to the United Nations
I done told my congressman and he said quote (dig this boy)
Sometimes, I wonder what I'm gonna do
But there ain't no cure
For the summertimes blues. Woah, there ain't no cure
