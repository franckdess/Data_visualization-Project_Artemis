When I was young, I knew everything
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we'd never compromise?
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

"Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place"

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we'd never compromise?
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, We were merely freshmen

We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We'd never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

"Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place"

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we'd never compromise?
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen
For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we'd never compromise?
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen
We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmen
