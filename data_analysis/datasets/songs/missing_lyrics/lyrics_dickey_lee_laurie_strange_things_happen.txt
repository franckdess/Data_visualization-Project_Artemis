Last night at the dance I met Laurie
So lovely and warm, an angel of a girl
Last night I fell in love with Laurie -
Strange things happen in this world
As I walked her home
She said it was her birthday
I pulled her close and said
"Will I see you anymore?"
Then suddenly she asked for my sweater
And said that she was very, very cold
I kissed her goodnight
At her door and started home
Then thought about my sweater
And went right back instead
I knocked at her door and a man appeared
I told why I'd come, then he said:
"You're wrong, son
You weren't with my daughter
How can you be so cruel
To come to me this way?
My Laurie left this world on her birthday -
She died a year ago today."
A strange force drew me to the graveyard
I stood in the dark
I saw the shadows wave
And then I looked and saw my sweater
Lyin' there upon her grave
Strange things happen in this world
