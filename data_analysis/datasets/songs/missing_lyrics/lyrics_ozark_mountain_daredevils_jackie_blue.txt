Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Hides that smile when she's wearin' a frown
Ooh Jackie, you're not so down
You like your life in a free-form style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
What's a game, girl, if you never lose
Ask a winner and you'll prob'bly find
Ooh Jackie, they've lost at sometime
Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy, just a nat'ral thing
Like playing music but you never sing
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places that you've never been
Ooh Jackie, you're going again
{guitar solo}
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like siftin' through sand
Ooh Jackie, it slips through your hand
Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sun set but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had
Ooh Jackie, ooh Jackie
Ooh Jackie, ooh Jackie, ooh Jackie
Hey, hey, hey, hey
