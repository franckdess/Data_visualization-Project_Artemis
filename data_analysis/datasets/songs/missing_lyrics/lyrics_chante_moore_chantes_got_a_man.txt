Listen

Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me
Your man's leaving you all alone
I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's so good to me

I'm sorry that your man ain't home
I'm sorry that yours left you alone
It's such a shame
Your man is playing games
And I heard you say
That men are all the same
No, no, no

It's not the truth, girl
Cause I got proof, girl
Oh I got proof, girl
I got a man at home

Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me
Your man's leaving you all alone
I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's sure good to me

Listen
Now why'd you let him beat you down?
No, no, what's up with that
There's good men around
Don't you know
How beautiful you are inside, girl
And don't you let nobody
Go and steal your pride
Oh no no, I know your thing, girl

It's not the truth, girl
Cause I got proof, girl
Oh I got proof, girl
I got a man at home

Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me
Your man's leaving you all alone
I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's so good to me

I once was where you are
Thought men were all the same
But I never gave up hope
And now my life has changed
Listen to me, girls
One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
He always treats me right
We never fight
He sends me flowers
And wines and dines me
Took me home to meet his mama
How he loves me
One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Give it one more try
Before you give up on love

Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me
Your man's leaving you all alone
I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's so good to me

That's my man calling me
Hello?
