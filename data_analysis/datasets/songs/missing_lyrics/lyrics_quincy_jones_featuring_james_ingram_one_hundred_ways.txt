Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play
Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer
All night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways

Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say
Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

Bein' cool won't help
You keep a love warm
You'll just blow your chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way
In your arms tonight
She'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways


In your arms tonight
She'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways

Ya better believe it, whoa
Love her today
Find one hundred ways
I'm telling you
To love her today
Find one hundred ways
Whoa, love her, love her
Love her one hundred ways
You've got to love her today
Find one hundred ways
