You should know, you should know that, ahh
Kris Kross is not having anything today
As we stand there totally crossed out
We commence to make ya (Jump jump)
The Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)
The Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)
Kris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)

Don't try to compare us (Yeah) to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad give ya something that you never had
I'll make ya bump hump wiggle and shake your rump
'Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna jump
How high? Real high! 'Cause I'm just so fly
A young lovable, hugable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'
R&B rap is bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'
Ain't nuthin' soft about Kris Kross, we all that
So when they ask, "Do they rock?," say, "Believe that!"

I like my stuff knockin' (Knockin')
I love it when the girlies be like jockin' (Jockin')
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
Yeah, you know me
I got you jumpin' an' bumpin' an' pumpin' movin' all around, G
In the mix, I made MC's step back
They tried to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nuthin' fake and you can understand every word (Word, hahaha)
As you listen to my cool, smooth melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P
