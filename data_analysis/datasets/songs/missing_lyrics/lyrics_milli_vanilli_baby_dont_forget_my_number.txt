Babe, don't be shy
When you're holding my hand
'Cause this time goes back
You got to understand
It's you
Ba, ba, ba baby
In your eyes
I see it so clearly
That our love it's so strong
And you never go wrong
I got the best for you
So I'm waiting down
If you need someone
Baby, call my line
Call me anytime
I'll be there for you
You, you
I've been searching high
High, high
I've been searching low

Ba, ba, ba, ba, baby
Don't forget my number
Baby, don't be stronger than a thunder
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baby
Don't forget my number
Love will see you through

I've been searching high
I've been searching low
I want to spend spend my life with you
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
My desper youth
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Love will see you through
Ba, ba baby
In your eyes
I see it so clearly
