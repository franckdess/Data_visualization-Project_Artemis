He remembers the first time he met er
He remembers the first thing she said
He remembers the first time he held her
And the night that she came to his bed
He remembers her sweet way of sayin
Honey has somethin gone wrong
He remembers the fun and the teasin
And the reason he wrote er this song
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
They would walk down the street in the evenin
And for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam of their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy
And I loved to go taggin along
Wed hold hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing er his song
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
Now he walks down the street in the evenin
And he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe hes believin
Hes holdin er hand like before
For he feels all her love walkin with him
And he smiles at the things she might say
Then the old man walks up to the hilltop
And gives her a daisy a day
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
