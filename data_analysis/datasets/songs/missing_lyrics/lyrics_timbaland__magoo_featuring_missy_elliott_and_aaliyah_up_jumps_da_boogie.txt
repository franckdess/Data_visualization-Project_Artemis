I fiend for all beats, like girls jump for dicks
Don't salt the next man, keep that Lindbergh shit
Up in the cut like gay niggas, in butt
I'm Black with Indian, my race should be mutt
I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
Evaluate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius
Up in the sky, up high don't puff lye
Do you smoke crack Sam, prepare to fuckin' die
Fuck Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight but I got ten more
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like Pop's feet, make sweat with no heat

I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia
Then call Maganoo to see if he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please, please brother don't slam my car door
It costs too much money to get that shit fixed
I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time for the shucking and jiving
Peep my rhyme cause that shit's off-timing

I'm in the Marriott, the place to get got
After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots
Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid named Scott
Me, my hot self, my self be so hot
Touch my hot spot, I scream til I can't stop, uhh
Give it to me daddy and uhh
Yup, yup like Teddy
Teddy, ready with the one two checker
No Diggity, Missy be the bedroom wrecka
Double-decker, make you wanna beat your pecker
And then leave your bitch, cause this (uh) be better

Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party

Prepare to get wet like Jheri Curl juice
You tight like virgin pussy, my rap get you loose
I bump like acne, take honey from a bee
My style is like a safe without the fucking key
I cum cause I'm a nut, don't bleed when I'm cut
No fan of Madonna, she just a damn slut
So sit you damn dog and bow to my shit
Nit-wit you stupid, I'm butter don't need grits
Make fits like seizure, lick clit to please ya
I book then read ya, follow the leader
Like Jews and Chinese, I own your rap lease
The wackness must cease, prepare for your release

I'm up in these labels trying to handle my business
Been making more beats before Jehovah had Witness
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me
Brother brother, please, turn on the TV
See a Black man dead, from a White man's powder
See a White man scared, from a Black man's power
Back to reality
Please don't freaking smile at me
This is a stick-up so give up your wallet please

I'm the best, and that's B and that's capital
I hang low like testicles, MC's wanna copy these many flows
Hoes, better back up, foe they get slapped up
Pack up and go tell Mommy that I backed up you
You you you, and your whole screw
What, whatcha whatcha whatcha gon' do uhh, what whatcha gon' do
To me, the M-I-double S-Y-E
Wanna battle me, it's gonna be some tragedy

Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
Give it up
We gon' show you how we party
