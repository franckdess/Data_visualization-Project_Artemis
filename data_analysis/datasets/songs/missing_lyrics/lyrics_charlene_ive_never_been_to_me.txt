Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

Ooo, I've been to Georgia
And California
And anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

Oh, I've been to Nice
And the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see

I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free

Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I've been to paradise
Never been to me
Been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I've sipped champagne on a yacht
I've been to paradise
Never been to me
