Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah, I wish she'd come walking over
Now I've been waiting to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over


Yeah (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
My my, such a sweet thing (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
I wanna do everything (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
What a beautiful feeling (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Crimson and clover (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Over and over


Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
