Dance, boogie wonderland
Dance, boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says "Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt
Dance, boogie wonderland
Dance, boogie wonderland
Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
"Boogie wonderland, wonderland"
Dance, boogie wonderland
Dance, boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Wonderland, wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
"Boogie wonderland, wonderland"
Dance, boogie wonderland
Dance, boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
