(There's a rose in black at spanish harlem)
(A rose in black at spanish harlem)

It is the special one
It never sees the sun
It only comes up
When the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft sweet and dreamy

(There is a rose in spanish harlem)
(A rose in black at spanish harlem)

With eyes as black as coal
That look down in his soul
It start a fire there and then he looses control
I'm gonna beg his par-ar-ar-ardon yeah
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In his garden

(There is a rose in spanish harlem uum uum)
(A rose in black at spanish harlem uum uum)

With eyes as black as coal
That look down in his soul
And start a fire there and then he loses control
And i wanna beg his par-ar-ar-don
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In his garden

(La-la-la- la la la la la la la)
