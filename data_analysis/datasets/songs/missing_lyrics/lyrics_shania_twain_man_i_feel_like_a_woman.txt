Let's go, girls!
Come on!

I'm going out tonight
I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout
No inhibitions
Make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...

Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!

The girls need a break
Tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance
We only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...

Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!

Oh, oh
Uh-huh
Oh, yeah

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun (Fun, fun)

Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild
Yeah, doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free
Yeah, to feel the way I feel (To feel the way I feel)
Man! I feel like a woman!

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
I get totally crazy
Can you feel it?
Come, come, come on, baby!
I feel like a woman!
