When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

Can I get to your soul? Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need, all the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you

Can I get to your soul? Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need, all the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside
I haven't seen you smilin' but I'm dying tonight

I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I
