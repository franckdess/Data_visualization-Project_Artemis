I can see that, it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed
And your words they lie
That's something you can't deny
I call, you're not at home
You're home, but you're not alone
If you wanna leave
Then why don't you say
Your love has gone anyway
I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
I know a good thing
Must come to an end
But it's hard to take
Losing a friend
I know what you think
And what's in your mind
So darling, why pretend?
I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on
There's something going on
