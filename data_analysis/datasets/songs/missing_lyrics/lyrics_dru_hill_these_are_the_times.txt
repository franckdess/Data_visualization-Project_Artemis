God knows that you're a sexy thang
It's taking everything in me
Not to kiss you over, under
Feel you inside, feel my thunder
How the hell could I not want you
Girl it don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you, You wait for me (Baby)
Cause true love is insisting
We don't have to rush at all (Baby yeah)

These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not at all

Be thinking 'bout you all the time
Morning, noon, and supper time, baby
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like reese's pieces
Come on girl you know I need it
(I know) It ain't supposed to be a thing
(I know) I'll wait for you, you wait for me
(And I know) True love's insisting we don't have to rush at all

These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not at all

I don't make promises
'Cause I know my heart gets weak
When I get around you girl
It makes them hard to keep (alright, alright, alright)
'Cause you bring out the best (yes you do)
Make me the man (oh, yes you do)
God knows I'm proud to be
Baby yeah

These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not at all
