I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on

And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said "the world comes right to my window every day"... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

And some day, you'll return to it)
