Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you, ooh

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Ooh baby, if there's anything that you fear
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
Yeah, mmm, yeah

And only we know what is talked about, baby boy
I don't know how you can be driving me so crazy, boy
Baby, when you're in town, why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me, boy

Oh, I won't tell (No, no, no) your secrets
(I will never, never, never)
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep (I will keep) your secrets (Your)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Everybody say whoa, whoa
Lemme hear you say whoa, whoa
Lemme hear you say whoa, whoa
I'm saying whoa, whoa
Lemme hear you say
I won't tell, I won't tell
I won't tell, I won't tell
I won't tell, I won't tell
Your secrets, your secrets
Break it down, oh
Secrets, secrets
