Some of you might know this song
It's an oldie but goodie
And if you know it, feel free to sing along with me and K-Ci tonight
K-Ci


Lately, I've had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
Around my mind
K-Ci, sing it
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
And with you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry, cry
‘Cause this time could mean good, goodbye
Bye-bye
Mmm, oh, won't you tell me, yeah

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Said, I'm trying to tell myself that I have no reason
With your heart, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
K-Ci, sing it, sing it
Now, just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But, uh, when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say that nothing changed

I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry, yeah, yeah, baby
‘Cause this time (time) could (could) mean (mean) good (good) bye
Goodbye, ooh yeah yeah
I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they al- (all)-ways (ways)
They always, they always start to cry
Yes, they do (Yes, they do); yes, they do; (ooh, yes, they do)
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye
It could mean goodbye (mean goodbye)
It could mean goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
Ooh yeah (Ooh yeah)
Whoa-oh...
Thank you
