I took my baby to the doctor with a fever

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying (Hee)

Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you
