Ooh...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...yeah
You glanced my way
I lost all control
Anxiety had taken hold
My body quivered
Hot flashes ignited in me, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words
I was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy, ooh, ooh
Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams
"Please make love to me"
You're the object of my desire
Baby, ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on
You're the object (Sugar) of my desire (Yeah)
Oh, baby, ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on
When I go to sleep at night
Visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me, ay-yi-yi-yi
I pinch myself as you're lyin' there
We kiss each other, now I'm really scared
Too much to ask even for a fantasy, oh, oh, oh
Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams
"Please make love to me"
'Cause you're the object of my desire (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on
You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on and on and on and on
You're the object (I've got to have your love)
(I need your love)
Object (Wanna be the one, baby)
Hey, you really turn me on
You're the object (Love so fine)
Baby (I wanna know), would you be mine
Object
Hey, you really turn me on and on and on and on
Object
Object
Hey, you really turn me on
