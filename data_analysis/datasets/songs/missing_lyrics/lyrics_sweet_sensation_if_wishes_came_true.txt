All alone
Silence fills my room
But in a memory
I hear you calling me
Close my eyes
And I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday
But then it fades away
Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true
Now you're gone
And I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams
I still feel your touch
Lying next to me
Feeling ecstasy
Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true
I love you madly
I need you badly
Give our love one more chance
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came truem
