Spring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages, we were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Agaaaaaaaaain

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Agaaaaaaaaain
Ahh ha


There will be another song for me
And I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it

I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun, yeah
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers from the sky
Oh, and after all the loves of my life, yeah yeah
After all the loves in my life
You'll still be the one
And I'll ask myself whyyyyy, yeah yeah


Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo
