You can boogie like disco, love that disco sound
Turn up the volume and move it all around
But don't, don't, don't, don't, don't forget, oh no
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't forget
The Stars On 45 keep on turning in your mind
Like "We Can Work It Out"
Remember "Twist and Shout"
You still don't "Tell Me Why" and "No Reply"
Sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Honey, ah sugar sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
1, 2, 3, 4...
This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you but I saw you peep through your window
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll come back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
And she said, "Baby, can't you see?"
"I wanna be famous, a star on the screen."
"But you can do something in between!"
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you
Listen, do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Oh, oh-a-oh, oh
Closer, let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you (oh-a-ooh-ooh)
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out
I should've know better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey
He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
You're gonna lose that girl
The Stars On 45 keep on turning in your mind
Like "We Can Work It Out"
Remember "Twist and Shout"
You still don't "Tell Me Why" and "No Reply"
