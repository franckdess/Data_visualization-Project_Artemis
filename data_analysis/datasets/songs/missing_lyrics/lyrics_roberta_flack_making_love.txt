Here... close to our feeling... we touch again.... we love again
Remember when we thought our hearts would never mend?
And we're all the better for each other
There's more to love, I know...than making love
Here... no more confusion
We see our lives, We live our lives
Remember when we thought we never would survive?
But now neither one of us is breaking
There's more to love, I know...than making love
Somethings never change
Somethings sometimes do
And now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in
And now neither one of us is breaking
Knowing now that there's more to love...than making love
And I remember you.....and making love
And I remember you...
And I remember you...oooo
And I remember you
And I remember you...ooo
