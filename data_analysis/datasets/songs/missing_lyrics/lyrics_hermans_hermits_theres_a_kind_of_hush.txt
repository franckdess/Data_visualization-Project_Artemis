There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight
All over the world you can hear the sounds of lovers in love
You know what I mean
Just the two of us and nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm feelin' good just holdin' you tight
So listen very carefully
Closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
"I love you forever and ever"
There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight
All over the world you can hear the sound of lovers in love
La la-la la-la la-la
La-la la-la la-la la-la
La-la-la-la-la la-la la-la-la
La la-la la-la
So listen very carefully
Closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
"I love you forever and ever"
There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight
All over the world, people just like us are falling in love
Yeah, they're falling in love
They're falling in love
