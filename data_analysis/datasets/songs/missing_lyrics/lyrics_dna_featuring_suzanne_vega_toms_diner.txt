I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
"It is always nice to see you"
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them
And instead I pour the milk
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope
And looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me
And so I raise my head
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
There's a woman on the outside
Looking inside, does she see me?
No, she does not really see me
Cause she sees her own reflection
And I'm trying not to notice
That she's hitching up her skirt
And while she's straightening her stockings
Her hair has gotten wet
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Oh, this rain it will continue
Through the morning as I'm listening
To the bells of the cathedral
I am thinking of your voice
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo doo
