I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

I know it's you and me babe
That makes this world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, come on and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh show me
Here I am babe, oooooaaah

It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart in two halves

Ooh I know it's you and me babe
That makes this world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh squeeze me
Here I am babe, oooooaaah


Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh show me
Show me what you can

Here I am babe, won't you take me?
Take me by the hand, take me by the hand
Ooohhhhh show me, show me what you can
Here I am babe, oh won't you take me?
Take me by the hand, take me while ya can
Here I am babeeeeee
