Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy
Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy

Say my lady
Tell me what's wrong with your boyfriend
Ah come on
He holds the key to your heart
But he don't love you baby, baby like I do
Only wanna be with you
Girl you are the love of my life, babe
And I'd give it to you baby
You belong to me and only me

I belong to you (I belong)
I'd give all my love to you

Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy
Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy

Say my lady
You are so fine
I wake up in the mornin' to see a smile on your face, baby
You are the queen of my heart, baby
I belong to you and you belong to me, yeah
Girl you are the love of my life, baby
All those cloudy days
They fade away when you come my way, baby

I belong to you (I belong)
I'd give all my love to you
(I belong, I belong, I belong to you, baby
Oh, oh oh oh, oh)

Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing (I belong)
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy (I belong, I belong, baby)
Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy (Higher, babe
Wanna get higher with your love
'Cause I belong)

I belong to you (Ooh)
I'd give all my love to you

Every time I see your face
It makes me want to sing
And every time I think about your love
It drives me crazy
