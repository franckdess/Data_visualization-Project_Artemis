It's five in the mornin'
And I'm up havin' phone sex witchu you, you (so horny, so horny)
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here lustin' for you, you (so horny, so horny)
Let's talk about sex baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love
Let's talk about you on top, or me goin' down
Let's have a little phone sex baby, on the hotline

On the hotline, the sun ain't up but, I had to call ya
Cuz I'm home alone lustin' for ya
I'm in my room, nothing' but a towel on
Take them granny panties off put a thong on
I love it when I hear ya moan
You got that sexy tone, that makes the dick long
You in a complete 'nother city on the fanline with nothin' but a baby tee on
You the kinda girl that's sexy in some boxer shorts
I'm the kinda nigga that make you ride it like a Porsche
Yeah, I met you on Myspace
Now I'm bout to fly you out to my place, in the mornin'


It's 5:30 in the morning, good morning
I'm horny and I'm lonely
I'm touching and rubbing
Call me, call me, you call me, you call me
Called you seven times baby girl don't stall me
I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in ya cheek, to the middle of your g-string
Conversation underneath the sheets
You know me, Red Bull like a energy, I'mma freak

Baby girl said she love phone sex
Say the sound of my deep voice make her wet
You call me five a.m. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' bout you with panties no top
Picture this, you say you comin' over
Thirty minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the do'
Three seconds in the house and ya panties on the flo'
Kiss you on ya mouth and ya hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Now you on the phone like damn I made a mess
Got my hands in my pants man I love phone sex
