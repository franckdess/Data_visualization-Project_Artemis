I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornin's I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me

Can we believe in fairytales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me

But now my love, hey didn't I love you
But we knew what had to be
Somehow my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me

Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me
Don't ask why
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me

But now my love, hey didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you, baby
Don't cry my love
I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me

I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me
(Didn't I love you, didn't I love you)
