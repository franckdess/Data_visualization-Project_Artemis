Up every morning just to keep a job
I gotta fight my way through the hustling mob
Sounds of the city poundin' in my brain
While another day goes down the drain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows
No one owns a piece of my time
And there's a five o'clock me inside my clothes
Thinkin' that the world looks fine, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
Tradin' my time for the pay I get
Livin' on money that I ain't made yet
I've been goin' tryin' to make my way
But I live for the end of the day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows
No one owns a piece of my time
And there's a long-haired girl who waits, I know
To ease my troubled mind, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
In the shelter of her arms everything's OK
When she talks, then the world goes slippin' away
And I know the reason I can still go on
When every other reason is gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In my five o'clock world, she waits for me
Nothing else matters at all
'Cause every time my baby smiles at me
I know that's it's all worthwhile, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
Oh my lady, yeah
