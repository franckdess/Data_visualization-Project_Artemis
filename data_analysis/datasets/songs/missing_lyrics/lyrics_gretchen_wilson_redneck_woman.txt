Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate

Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

Victoria's Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Walmart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (Sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV

No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me
You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say "hey, y'all" and "yee-haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "hell yeah" from the redneck girls
Like me

(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!
(Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah!
(Hell yeah!)
I said hell yeah!
