Where do they get off telling you
That I am not the least bit into you?
Just tell me how the hell they can tell you
They know what's in my heart
What do they get from telling you
That I don't give a damn about?
Just tell me why the hell
Somebody wants to tear your heart apart

Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do them people like to tell you lies?
I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way?
I can't take much more, I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You can know that from this moment
You are always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do love you
You'll be always in my heart

They're not the ones who'll be there for you
When you need someone to turn to
They won't be anywhere
Be anywhere when things start falling down, oh yeah yeah
They're only in it to confuse you
So they can turn around and use you
But it can't happen
It won't happen, girl, as long as I'm around

Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do some people like to tell you lies?
I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way?
I can't take much more, I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do (saying I do, yeah)
You can know that from this moment
You are always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you, baby
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do (I do) love you (love you, baby)
You'll be always in my heart

Oh, why
Why, why, why

Why did you have to listen to the lies?
Oh, girl
My sweet girl
There is only you inside my world
Oh, please, baby, please
Yeah, I wish you could believe in me
Right now, right now
If only you could know

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You can know that from this moment
You are always in my heart
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do love you
