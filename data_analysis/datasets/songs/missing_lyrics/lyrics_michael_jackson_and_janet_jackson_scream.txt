[Intro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson
Yeah, yeah!
With my nigga mike
Hoo-hoo!
Scream nigga!
2Pac, yo!
Makaveli the dawn!

Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting
So what does it mean
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks
Woo!

Yeah
3, 2, 1
They claim that I'm violent (violent!)
For trying to be free (come get me!)
And if you stay silent (speak, nigga!)
There'll never be peace ("fuck peace!")
Why do we work like slaves? (Fuck that!)
It's time that we hit 'em up (nigga I hit 'em up!)
'Cause when we go to the grave
Nobody else'll give a fuck, that's what's up

With such confusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
(all my niggas scream!)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (all my niggas scream!)>
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it!>
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressuring me
(Just stop fucking with me!)
Make me wanna scream (scream!
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
(Just stop fucking with me!)
It makes me just wanna scream
(Scream!)

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice
All the injustice

Throw your hands up

With such confusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
(all my niggas scream!)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(all my niggas scream!)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it!
Just stop, just stop, just stop just stop!
Just stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressuring me
(Just stop fucking with me!)
Make me wanna scream (scream!)
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
(Just stop fucking with me)
It makes me just wanna scream
(Scream!)
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressuring me
(Just stop fucking with me!)
Make me wanna scream (scream!)
