So hot, hot
It's the S the L the I the M

Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna freak, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always again with you
So sweet, I can't forget
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

Peaches and cream (Oooh)
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (That's right)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
(Girl you taste so good to me)
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby right next to you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the smell of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

Got your arms around my neck and I can't get up
