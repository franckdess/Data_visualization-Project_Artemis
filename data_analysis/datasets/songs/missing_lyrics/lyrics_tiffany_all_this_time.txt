All this time
I knew someday you'd need to find
Something that you left behind
Something I can't give you
All these tears
And like a light
Love disappears
But hearts are good for souvenirs
And memories are forever
All this time
All in all
I've no regrets
The sun still shines
The sun still sets
The heart forgives
The heart forgets
But what will I do now
With all this time
One more kiss
Even though it's come to this
I'll close my eyes
And make a wish
Hoping you remember
All this time
All in all
I've no regrets
The sun still shines
The sun still sets
The heart forgives
The heart forgets
But what will I do now
With all this time
Say goodbye
Apart
We'll make another try
But don't be sorry
If you cry
I'll be crying too
On this day
All this time
All in all
I've no regrets
The sun still shines
The sun still sets
The heart forgives
The heart forgets
But what will I do now
With all this time
