Everyday I hear a different story
People say that you're no good for me
So you love another
And she's making a fool of you, oh
If you love me baby
Don't deny it
But you left me
And tell me I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby
And I will understand

But to know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could take me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody's baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't need your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool
To give you all that I do
Bet you someday, baby
Someone says the same to you

But to know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could take me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do, oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody's baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't need your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you

But to know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby
You could take me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do, oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don't want nobody's baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don't want nobody's baby
Part-time love just brings me down

I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
Oh...
