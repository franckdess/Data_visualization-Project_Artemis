Love is forever - As I lie awake
Beside you
I believed - There's no heaven
No hideaway - For the lonely
But I was wrong - Crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right
Ohh - Only wanted to stay awhile
Only wanted to play awhile
Then you taught me to fly like a bird
Woooh, Woooh
Baby - Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before - Yeah yeah
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
'cause what I got there ain't no, cure for
Ooh, it's so easy
What you do to me all night angel
I never loved - Swear to God
Never needed no one - 'til you came along
But here I come - Baby
It's gotta be strong - It's gotta be right
Ohh - Only wanted to stay awhile
Only wanted to play awhile
Then you taught me to fly like a bird
Woooh, Woooh
Baby - Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before - Yeah yeah
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
'cause what I got there ain't no, cure for
I feel fast asleep - I feel drunk
I dream the sweetest dreams
Never wanna wake up
Never thought it could be this way
No doubt about it - Can't live without it - Baby
Never thought it could be this good
You made love to me - Like it oughta be
But I was wrong - Crazy
It's gotta be strong
It's gotta be right
Ohh - Only wanted to stay awhile
Only wanted to play awhile
Then you taught me to fly like a bird
Woooh, Woooh
Baby - Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Such a night I never had before - Yeah yeah
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
'cause what I got there ain't no, cure for
Gotta say!
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven
Never thought that I could
Feel this way - Yeah
It's gotta be love - It's gotta be love
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven - Heaven
Thought I'd died and gone to heaven baby
