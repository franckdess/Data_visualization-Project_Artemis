I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen them all but ain't none of them at all (Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just (Like you)
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

And every time I think about you
When you ride, when you call, when you come ('Round)
Your love is amazing to me
I can't wait 'til I see you - I wanna be with you again
And every time you're out on the road (I make a trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)
That I'm your main chick who got that game chick
One and the same chick - the one you can hang with

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

Okay, when you hit the mall pop tags spend a few G's
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', I spoil the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I shared more
I give you dis give you dat what you need love
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't trying to let you go
I get wit you when I can so that's how I let you know
And you be tripping cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one to I holla to right after my shows
And I was tripping in a sense I was tense
But my body loose around you what I'mma do without you
I gotta get it together say whatever
But since I met you, my life seem so better

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you
