Wearing nothing is Divine
Naked is a state of mind
I take things off to clear my head
To say the things I haven't said
Live inside the elements
The earth and sky are my best friends
Water is the evidence
That washes me from end to end
With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see
It's not a choice I tried to make
It's not a thought I couldn't take
Something told me it was time
To give you yours and leave me mine
My vision started to be clear
I watched the sunlight coming near
I knew the day I knew the night
I knew I could regain my sight
And it feels alright
And it feels alright
(It feels alright)
With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
(It feels alright)
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see

Last night I came into your home
To break some ice and throw some stones
I asked if we could be alone
I had some troubles of my own
Knew I had to say goodbye
To all the old things held inside
If I let the moment fly
I knew they'd all be magnified
And it feels alright
And it feels alright
Came around after dark
You are nothing but a lark
Know I snuck in like a narc
I knew I had to leave my mark
Wanted to be satisfied
I tried to be dignified
Wearing nothing is Divine
Naked is a state of mind
And it feels alright
And it feels alright
(It feels alright)
With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
(It feels alright)
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see

It feels alright, it feels alright
It feels alright, it feels alright
(Naked is a state of mind)
(It feels alright)
With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
(Naked is a state of mind)
(It feels alright)
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see
It feels alright,it feels alright
It feels alright
