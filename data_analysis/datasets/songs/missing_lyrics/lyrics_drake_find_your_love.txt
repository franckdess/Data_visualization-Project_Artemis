I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember andâ€”

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
