Crying on my pillow, lonely in my bed
Then I heard a voice beside me and she softly said
Wonder is your night light, magic is your dream
And as I held her, she said, see what I mean
I said what?
She said oo-oo-oo wee
I said all right
She said love me, love me, love me
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere) Yeah, somewhere
Heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow (undercover)
I'm givin' up my heart to you, now angel don't go
She said, go find the right one, love her and then (undercover)
When you look into her eyes, you'll see me again
I said what?
She said oo-oo-oo wee
I said all right
She said love me, love me, love me
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere) Woah, somewhere
Now you know my story and, girl, if it's right
I'm gonna take you in my arms and love you tonight
Underneath the covers, the answer lies
I'm lookin' for my angel in your sweet lovin' eyes
She said what?
I said oo-oo-oo wee
She said all right
I said lay next to me
She said what?
I said oo-oo-oo wee
She said all right
She said love me, love me, love me
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me (ooh)
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me
Love me, love me, love me
Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
Out there somewhere
