There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
When they...

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive
Looking for something wild

And now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight, I don't give aâ€‹ (I don't give a, I don't give a...)

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around

N-now we looking so smashed, knockin' over trash cans
E'rybody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm gonna get faded, I'm not the designated driver
So, I don't give a (I don't give a, I don't give a...)

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)

Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off), oh-oh
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off, everybody take it off), oh-oh

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
