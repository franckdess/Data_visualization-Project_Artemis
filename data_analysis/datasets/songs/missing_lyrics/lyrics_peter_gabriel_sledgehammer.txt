Hey, hey, you
Tell me how have you been?

You could have a steam train
If you just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
Oh, let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

Show me 'round your fruit cage
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

Sledge, sledge
Sledgehammer


I get it right
I kicked the habit
Kicked the habit, kicked the habit
Shed my skin
Shed my skin
This is the new stuff
This is the new stuff
I go dancing in
We can go dancing in
Oh, won't you show for me?
Show for me

Show for you
