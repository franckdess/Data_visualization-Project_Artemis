Huhhh uhh yeah yeahh yeahh
Oohhh oohh oohh oohh oohh
Huhhh uhh uhhhhh
Hehhhh ehhhhh ehhhhhhhh ehhhhhh ehhhhh

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

I often tell myself that we could be
More than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around (round round)
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

I often fantasize the stars above
Are watching you
They know my heart and speak to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes
I'd pretend I was you
And lose control

There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

Running in and out my life
Has got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice
Somebody's got to choose
We can make it if we try, for the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

You've got the right to lose control
Don't let go
Don't let go 'cause I can't pretend

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

What's it gonna be?
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't you wanna be?
Don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
