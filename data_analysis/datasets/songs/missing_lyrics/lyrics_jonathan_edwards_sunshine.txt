Sunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
When he tells me I better get in line
I can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine
These ain't dues I been paying
Well, how much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
And he can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine
Sunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
Working starts to make me wonder where
Fruits of what I do are going
When he says in love and war, all is fair
He's got cards he ain't showing
How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
And he can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine
Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells will be ringing
