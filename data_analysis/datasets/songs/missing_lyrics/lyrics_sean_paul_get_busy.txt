Shake dat ting miss, Cana, Cana
Shake dat ting miss, Annabella
Shake dat ting yow, Donna Donna

Woman, get busy
Jus shake dat booty non-stop
When da beat drops, jus keep swingin' it
Get jiggy, get crunked up
Percolate anyting you want to call it
Oscillate you hip and don't take pity
Me wah fi see you get live 'pon di riddim when me ryde
And me lyrics a provide electricity
Gyal nobody cah tell you nuttin'
Ca you don't know your destiny

Yo, sexy ladies want par wid us
Inna di car wid us, dem nah war wid us
Inna di club dem wah flex wid us
To get next to us, dem cah vex wid us
From di day me born jah ignite me flame

It's all good, girl, turn me on
'Til a early morn', let's get it on

Let's get it on 'til a early morn'
Girl, it's all good, jus turn me on
