Nigga, I'm the colonel of the motherfuckin tank
Y'all after big thangs, we after big bank
3rd Ward hustlas, soldiers in combat
Convicts and dealers, and killers with TRU tats
Never gave a fuck bout no hoes on our riches
And niggas come short, I'm diggin ditches
M.P. pullin stripes, commander-in-chief
And fools run up wrong, nigga I'm knockin out some teeth
I'm down here slangin, rollin with these hustlers
Tryin to get rid of all you haters and you bustas
Steppin on toes, break a niggas nose
In the projects niggas anything goes
Breakin fools off cause I'm a No Limit soldier
At ease now salute, this pass me the doja

Make em say uhh (uhh)
Na-nah na-nah (na-nah na-nah)

Fiend exercisin his right of exorcism, bustin out the Expedition
Bullets choppin haters business to about the size of prisms our mission
They heard we scary, No Limit mercenary
No tellin how bad it get, because the worst'll vary
I heard you make em worry, that this for the loot
They intimidated by the rounds that the tank shoot
Tank Dogs salute! Every robbery in store, cause they know
Everything Fiend know, mean mo' money mo'
Little Fiend still want the greens, the cornbread and the cabbage
In your hood, remindin you bitches of who the baddest
Definitely the maddest, so the crime gon' stick em up

Na-nah na-nah (na-nah na-nah)

We capitalize and monopolize on everything we see keep pistols drawed
And cocked, we got the industry locked, we can't be stopped, too hot
Check the spots that we got, on Billboard
This Tank can set up roadblocks, we fadin all you hoes
Want some mo? Then let's go, stretch you out like elastic
Zip that ass up in plastic, have ya folks pickin caskets
We drastic, our tactics is homegrown in the ghetto
So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mamma Mia
The Unlady Like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away
So stay in yo' place, when ya hear mamma speakin
Cannon spray, clear the way, when ya see The Tank creepin

Make em say uhh (uhh)
Na-nah na-nah (na-nah na-nah)

I'm that nigga that rappers look up to when they won't know how to do it
Used to be the little bitty skinny motherfucker with the braids in his hair
Used to live on Tchoupitoulas
I done paid my dues, but still played the blues
Nigga play me like you was scared to lose
I'm still a fool, you ain't heard the news
Iâ€™m with them No Limit niggas, makin' major moves
I won't stop now, bitch, I can't stop
You can't stop me, so bitch don't try we
We TRU soldiers, we don't die
We keep rollin, na-nah-nah-nah-nah
All aboard, bitch could get barely inside
The Riverboat Hallelujah
Niggas goin to war, got to fightin and shootin inside Rumors
Bitches be sayin he there, we there, BEWARE!!!
C there, Silkk there Fiend there, Mamma there, P there
Ain't no salary cap, on top of my dollars

Watch how many bitches get wild, na-nah na-nah

Make em say uhh (uhh)
Na-nah na-nah (na-nah na-nah)
