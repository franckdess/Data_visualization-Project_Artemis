Faded photograph
Covered now with lines and creases
Tickets torn in half
Memories in bits and pieces
Traces of love long ago
That didn't work out right
Traces of love
Ribbons from her hair
Souvenirs of days together
The ring she used to wear
Pages brown from old love letter
Traces of love long ago
That didn't work out right
Traces of love with me tonight
I close my eyes and say a prayer
That in her heart she'll find
A trace of love still there
Somewhere, oh, oh
Traces of hope in the night
That she'll come back and dry
These traces of tears from my eyes
