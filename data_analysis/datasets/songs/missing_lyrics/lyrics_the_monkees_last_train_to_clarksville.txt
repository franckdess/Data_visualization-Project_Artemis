{Intro}
{verse}
Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
Cause I made your reservation
Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again
We'll have one more night together
Till the morning brings my train and I must go
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Take the last train to Clarksville
I'll be waiting at the station
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses
And a bit of conversation, oh
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
{bridge}
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Take the last train to Clarksville
Now I must hang up the phone
I can't hear you in this noisy railroad station all alone
I'm feeling low
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Ohhh
Ahhhhhhh
Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
Cause I made your reservation
Don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Take the last train to Clarksville (repeat and fade)
