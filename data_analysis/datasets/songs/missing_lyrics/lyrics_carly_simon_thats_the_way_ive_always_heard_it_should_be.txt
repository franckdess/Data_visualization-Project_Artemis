My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I walk by, no remark
I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
I hear her call sweet dreams
But I forgot how to dream

But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own
You and me
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry

My friends from college
They're all married now
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Tearful nights, angry dawns
Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
And yet they drink, they laugh
Close the wound
Hide the scar

But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own
You and me
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry

You say we can keep our love alive
Babe, all I know is what I see
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris
You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
By myself

Well, O.K
It's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own
You and me
Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry
We'll marry
