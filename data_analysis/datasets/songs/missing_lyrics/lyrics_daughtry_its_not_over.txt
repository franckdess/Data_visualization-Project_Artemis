I was blown away
What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away

Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
Try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away

Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
Try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

Let's start over
Try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

Let's start over
It's not over, yeah
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over
