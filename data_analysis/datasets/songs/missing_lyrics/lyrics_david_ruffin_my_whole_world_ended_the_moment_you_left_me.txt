Last week my life had meaning
It was beautiful and so sweet
But now it's nothing
Nothing without you, baby
My whole world is incomplete
'Cause honey I can't see you no more
That was all that you said, baby
But you just might as well have
Placed a gun to my head
Baby, baby, oh, why did you do it

My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Yeah, yes it did, honey
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby

Did you ever mean those sweet things
Ah, that you use to say
Did you mean 'em baby
Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden
And a little baby someday
Oh, tell me, baby
Where did I go wrong, honey
Whatever changed your mind, baby
I've asked myself these questions over a million times
Baby, baby, oh, baby

My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, baby, baby
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby

Oh baby, now my body is numb
I feel, feel so senseless to the touch
My life is so wasted
So wasted without you
I guess I love too much, too much
Oh, baby, how can I face tomorrow
When yesterday is all I see
I just don't want to face tomorrow
If you're not sharing it with me
Baby, baby, oh, tell me why

My whole world ended
The moment you left me
Oh, yes it did, baby, baby
My whole world ended
The moment you left me
It tumbled down to the ground
Baby, I keep holding on, holding on
Although your love is gone, baby
