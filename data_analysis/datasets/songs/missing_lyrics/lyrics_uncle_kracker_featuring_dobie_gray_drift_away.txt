Day after day, I'm more confused
Yet, I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose

And I'm feelin' the strain
Oh, ain't it a shame?

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

Beginin' to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind

And I'm countin' on you
You can carry me through

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Won't you take me away?

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue
The guitars come in through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
(Ooh, the joy that you've given me)
I want you to know that I believe in your song (oh, yeah)
Your rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony (mm)
You helped me along (makin' me strong)
Oh, you're makin' me strong

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away (drift away, ooh)
And give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away (drift away)

Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away (drift away, oh)
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Yeah, won't you take me?
Won't you take me?
I wanna drift away (won't you take me away?)
I wanna drift away
I wanna drift away (won't you take me?)
Take me home
Let me drift away
Won't you take me away?
