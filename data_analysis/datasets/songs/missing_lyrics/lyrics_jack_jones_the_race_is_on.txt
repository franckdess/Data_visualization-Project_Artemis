There's a fool in the mirror
Looking back across the bar
Reflections of a woman
Whose world just fell apart

Now the life we built together
And the golden rings are gone
And it's whiskey versus memories
And it looks like the race is on

I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind

The cowboys in the corner are making eyes at me
But I just want to be alone with your memory
Now the music's good and country and the whiskey's feeling right
You won't be back but George and Jack will help me through the night

I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind

I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
