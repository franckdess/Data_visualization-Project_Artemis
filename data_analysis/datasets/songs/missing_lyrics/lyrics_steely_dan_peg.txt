I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it
Peg

I like your pin shot
I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

Peg, it will come back to you
Peg, it will come back to you
Then the shutter falls
You see it all in 3-D
It's your favorite foreign movie
