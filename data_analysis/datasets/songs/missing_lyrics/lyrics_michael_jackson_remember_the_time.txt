Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
(Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

(Remember the time)
Ooh!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Ooh! In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, woo!
(Remember the time, remember the time)
