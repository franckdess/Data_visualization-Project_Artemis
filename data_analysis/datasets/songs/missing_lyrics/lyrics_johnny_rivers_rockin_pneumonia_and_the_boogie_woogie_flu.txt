I wanna jump, but I'm afraid I'll fall
I wanna holler, but the joint's too small
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
Want some lovin' babe and that ain't all
I wanna kiss her, but she's way too tall
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
Wanna squeeze her, but I'm way too low
I would be runnin' but my feets too slow
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
I wanna squeeze her, but I'm way too low
I would be runnin' but my feets too slow
Young man rhythm got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
Baby comin', now, I'm hurryin' home
I know she's leavin', 'cause I'm takin' too long
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
