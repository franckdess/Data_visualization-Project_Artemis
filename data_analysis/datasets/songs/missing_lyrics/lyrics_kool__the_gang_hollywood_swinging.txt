Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Hollywood

I remember not too long ago
I went to the theater
And I saw the Kool in the gang show
I always wanted to fit a band, yes I did
To sing my songs, sing my songs
And become a bad piano playing man
So here I am, here I am in this Hollywood city
The city of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess, I guess I have to stay
Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
What ya got to say?
Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging, yea, that's what they're doin'
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Yea yea, Hollywood, that's how they're doin' it, Hollywood
I've figured all the swinging down, down in Hollywood
Moving, swinging down say, say, I like to do it
And Kool's got the swinging of the dance
Get down, get down in Hollywood
You know that Hollywood is swinging down, yea
You know that, you know that, you know that, you know that
Hollywood is swinging down
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, now swinging
