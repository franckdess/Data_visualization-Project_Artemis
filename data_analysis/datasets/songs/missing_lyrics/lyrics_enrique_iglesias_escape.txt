You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
You and me, up and down
But maybe this time we'll get it right, worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks
All it takes is some trying

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go
You should know
It's hard to just forget the past so fast
It was good, it was bad, but it was real
And that's all you have in the end, our love mattered

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (I won't beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run (You can run)
You can hide (You can hide)
But you can't escape my love (My love)
You can run (You can run)
You can hide (You can hide)
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
All it takes is some trying
Baby, you can run...

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (I won't beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding (You'll be finding)
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
You can't escape my love
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run
You can run
You can run
Baby, you can run, baby, you can hide
You can run
But you can't escape my love
You can run
Baby, you can run, baby, you can hide
You can run
But you can't escape my love
You can run
Baby, you can run, baby, you can hide
You can run
But you can't escape my love
You can run
You can run
You can run, you can hide, but you can't escape my love
