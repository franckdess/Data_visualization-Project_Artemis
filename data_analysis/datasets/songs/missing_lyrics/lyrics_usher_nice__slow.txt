What you doing?
Really?
You know I'm coming over, right?
(Now, baby, tell what you wanna do with me?)
Now, you got it hot for me already, baby?
Okay
Be there in about...
Uh, give me ten minutes
Be ready
Hey, wear that little thing I like, yeah
(Now, baby, tell what you wanna do with me?)

It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top, cruising the streets
I got a real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
I pull up, anticipating
Good love, don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I never seen, girl, you know what I mean

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me?)
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me?)

Now here we are, driving round town
Contemplating where I'm gonna lay you down
Girl, you got me saying, "my, my, my (my)
"I wish that I (I) could pull over
And get this thing started right now"
I wanna do something freaky to you, baby
I don't think they heard me
I, I wanna do something freaky to you, baby
So call out my name

They call me U-S, H-E-R, R-A, Y-M, O-N-D
Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me?
Got a nigga feenin' like Jodeci
Every time that you roll with me, holding me
Trying to get control of me, nice and slowly
You know, never letting go, never messing up the flow
This is how the hook go, come on

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt, ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me?)
See, I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be making love until the sun comes up, baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now, baby, tell me what you wanna do with me?)

Now tell me, do you wanna get freaky?
'Cause I'll freak you right, I will
I'll freak you right, I will
I'll freak you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I'll freak you right, I will
