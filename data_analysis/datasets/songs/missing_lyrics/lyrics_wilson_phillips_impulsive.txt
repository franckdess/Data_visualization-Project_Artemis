The secret of love
I thought I understood
The way it's supposed to be
I never imagined you could
Blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain
My heart it's beating don't say no
My head keeps saying, "Take it slow"

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss
You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Ooh this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

I am reckless, impulsive
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart, my heart

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss
You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

Impulsive, I wanna be, impulsive
I'm gonna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself, lose myself
