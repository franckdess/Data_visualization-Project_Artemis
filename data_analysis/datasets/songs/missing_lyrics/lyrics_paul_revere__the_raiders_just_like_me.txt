It's just like me
To say to you
Love me do
And I'll be true
And what I'd like
For you to say
Is you'll come home
To me each day
Hiku be my girl
That's what I want
Just you sweet thing
And not a thing
It's just like me
To feel so good
And fall so much
In love with you
It's just like me
It's just like me
I'm acting the fool
That's how I'll be
But it's just like you
To say goodbye
And leave me all
Alone at night, waaa
It's just like me
To say to you
Love me do
And I'll be true
And what I'd like
For you to say
Is that you'll love me
Here each day
It's just like me
It's just like me
I'm acting the fool
That's how I'll be
But it's just like you
To say goodbye
And leave me all
Alone at night, waaa
It's just like me
It's just like me...
