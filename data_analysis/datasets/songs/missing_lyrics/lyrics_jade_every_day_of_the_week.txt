Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ooh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah

You were looking so good to me
The night we met
I could not see
How deep you were to penetrate my heart
Mmm
Now that some time has passed
It made me think this was meant to last
I never wanna be apart
Oh, no, no
Don't let me fool you
If I'm acting kinda cold to you
It's just a little game I like to play
Cause when we're together
It just keep getting better
If I had my way

When do I wanna see you?
When do I wanna please you?
Every day of the week
When do I wanna love you?
When am I thinking of you?
Every day of the week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Even on Sunday
Every day of the week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Even on Sunday
Every day of the week

I only wanted good times, baby
You wanted the same
So maybe this is written in the stars for us
Mmm
All I know is with you inside me
The more we kiss
The more I like it
I never wanna give you up

When do I wanna see you
(See you?)
When do I wanna please you?
Every day of the week
(Oh, oh, oh)
When do I wanna love you
(Ho, oh)
When am I thinking of you
Every day of the week

Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Even on Sunday
Every day of the week
(Every, every day of the week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Even on Sunday
Every day of the week
(Baby, baby, yeah)

I wanna see you
I wanna have you, baby
Baby, I need you to be right my side
I wanna love you

When do I wanna see you?
(Ho)
When do I wanna please you?

Every day of the week
