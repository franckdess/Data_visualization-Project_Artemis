So you heard that I'm a rebel
With a heart made of stone
I got a restless spirit
That nobody can own
If a picture tells a story
Won't you listen to mine
I'm searching for the answer
But it's so hard to find
You'll see much deeper
When you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire
Burning in my eyes
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
I willing to fight
Love can be so heartless
When you turn out the lights
A mutual surrender
In the heat of the night
Life's an empty picture
When you're living alone
Maybe that's the reason
Every heart needs a home
Each time I fall down
I get on my feet again
I'm gonna win this battle
In the end
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
You'll see much deeper
When you read between the lines
Cause there's a fire
Burning in my eyes
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, I'm a soldier of love
Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, a soldier for your love
Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
