Man, man
Look at the sky
All the stars, man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em

Ghetto supastar (Supastar)
That is what you are (That's what you are)
Coming from afar (Coming from afar)
Reaching for the stars (Reaching from the stars)
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh (Yeah)
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Pa-Pa-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar (Uh-huh)
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

One, two, and you don't stop, yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pel√©, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling, "Ole!"
Who the hell wanna save me?, From B.K. to Cali

Ghetto supastar (Come on, uh)
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
Two-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

Well, I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see, I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
(Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh)
From one corner to another, uh-huh (yeah)
(All-stars)
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me (Sing it, baby) to another place (Sing it, baby)
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, yeah)
(Heeee, ahhh)
