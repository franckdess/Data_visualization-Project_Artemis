Come on feet, start movin'
Got to get me there
Hey, hey, uh, huh, huh, huh
Oh, uh, huh, huh, huh, yeah, oh

Twenty five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now, I've been walking for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty mad
But I got a woman waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see she's got
The kind of lovin' and a kissin'
A make a man go stone wild

So I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on, oh, ho, ho
I-I-I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
It's as if it's though
I'm standing at her front door
I can hear that doggone plain
Now, I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
Now, when I kiss her lips
I turn her back over flip
And I'll forget about these feet of mine

I got to keep on walkin'
Hey, I got to walk on, let me tell y-y'all
I-I-I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Come on feet don't fail me now
I got ten more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven, six, six, six
I got five more miles to go now
Over the other hill just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get to my baby again

I got to keep on walkin'
Hey I got to walk on, wait, let me tell y-y-y'all
I-I-I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
Walkin', yeah
I got to walk on, let me tell y-y-y'all
I see my baby
Just across the bend
Walkin', hey, hey now
I got to walk on, let me tell y-y-y'all
I got to say, on the step
Since the sun came up
