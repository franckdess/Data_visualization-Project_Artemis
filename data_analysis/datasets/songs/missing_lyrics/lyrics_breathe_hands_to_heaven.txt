As I watch you move
Across the moon-lit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow, I must leave
The dawn knows no reprieve
God give me strength when I am leaving

So raise your hands to heaven
And pray
That we'll be back together someday

Tonight
I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight
You calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

As we move to embrace
Tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I can't believe this pain
It's driving me insane
Without your touch
Life will be lonely



Morning has come
Another day
I must pack my bags
And say goodbye
Goodbye
