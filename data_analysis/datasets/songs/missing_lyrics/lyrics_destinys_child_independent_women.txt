Lucy Liu
With my girl, Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on
Uh, uh, uh

Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh, and I pay my own bills
Always 50-50 in relationships

The shoes on my feet, I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought it
The rock I'm rocking, I bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing, I bought it
The house I live in, I bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me (I depend on me)

All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas, who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies, who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

Tell me how you feel about this
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy being independent
Question, how'd you like this knowledge that I brought?
Bragging on that cash that he gave you is to front
If you're gonna brag, make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want

The shoes on my feet, I bought it

The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me (I depend on me)

All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money

Destiny's Child, wassup?
You in the house? Sure 'nuff
We'll break these people off, Angel style
Child of Destiny, independent beauty
No one else can scare me
Charlie's Angels, woah

All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas, who profit dollars
