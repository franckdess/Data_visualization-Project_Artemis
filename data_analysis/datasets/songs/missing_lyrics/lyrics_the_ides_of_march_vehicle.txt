{Intro}

Hey, well, I'm the friendly stranger in the black sedan
Woncha hop inside my car
I got pictures, I got candy, I'm a lovable man
And I can take you to the nearest star

I'm your vehicle, baby
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
I'm your vehicle woman
By that I'm sure you know
I love ya (love ya)
I need ya (need ya)
I wants ya gots to have you child
Great God in heaven, you know I love you
(Oh you know I do)

Well, if you wants to be a movie star
I canna take-a you to Hollywood
But if you wanna stay just like you are
You know, I think you really should

I'm your vehicle, baby
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
I'm your vehicle woman
By that I'm sure you know
I love ya (love ya)
I need ya (need ya)
I wants ya gots to have you child
Great God in heaven, you know I love you
(Oh you know I do)
