I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
'Cause I ain't tryin' to control her

She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinkie ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene

I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change

I'm easy tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans

Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm talking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot

She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, east up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep

You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby
You know that I'm comin' baby

Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up

Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And every time I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight

But only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Only if you got that sip type

Eat that shit like won ton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep

You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby
You know that I'm comin' baby

Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, H-Town, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, shit
