Look over yonder
What do you see?
The sun is a-rising
Most definitely
A new day is coming (whoo-hoo!)
People are changing
Ain't it beautiful? (whoo-hoo!)
Crystal Blue Persuasion

Better get ready
Gonna see the light
Love, love is the answer (whoo-hoo!)
And that's alright
So don't you give up now (whoo-hoo!)
So easy to find
Just look to your soul (look to your soul!)
And open your mind


Crystal Blue Persuasion, Mm-hmm
It's a new vibration
Crystal Blue Persuasion, Crystal
Blue Persuasion

Maybe tomorrow
When he looks down
In every green field (whoo-hoo!)
And every town
All of his children
In every nation
There'll be, Peace and Good
Brotherhood
Crystal Blue Persuasion, Yeah

Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Oh!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
Crystal Blue Persuasion, ah-ha!
