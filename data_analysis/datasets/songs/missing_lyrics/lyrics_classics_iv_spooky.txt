{Intro}

In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kinda groovy
I call you up and ask you
Would you like to go with me and see a movie
At first you say no you've got some plans for tonight
And then you stop and say, "alright"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a fellow looks at you
You'd be sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you
Spooky!


If you decide someday
To stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart's been a-dying to be saying
Just like a ghost
You've been a-haunting my dreams
So I propose on Halloween
Love is kinda crazy
With a spooky little girl like you

Spooky!
Spooky!
I said  Spooky...
