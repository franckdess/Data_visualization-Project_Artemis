I'm desiring my insightful minded atoms (adam's) to make a Dent
Like Hitchhiker's Guide and since I was nine I've been finding
It's a thrilling science, writing, kinda like I'm Michael Crichton
So I'm delighted when the lines that I've designed and rhymed
Are listened to and complied with as though provided by Simon
Sometimes my fans inquire “AllOne we love the sentiments you ponder
But they're getting hard to harbor, why not settle instead of wander
On the vessel of the sonic instrumentals that you wanna slyly
Pen a bit of your proper timely rhetoric in your mantra's rhyme schemes?”
Which is when I'll then respond and try teaching
“hasn't your generous affection hinged on my thoughtful side themes?
Well I experiment at a constant to keep my mind free
Which then again reminds me you can't spell “generic” without “genre, I C(I see)”
My a capellas have hushed pubs where crowds were acting rowdy
And my rapping's turned taciturn cafes nerds to fans clapping, loudly
Why chase the goal and easy route of adapting to my surroundings
When I'm capable of changing all the patterns right around me?
I'm influenced by authors and poets as much as music's might
I utilize my muses ideas to entice beautiful lines
I'll never choose to write aggressive stupid rhymes resembling useless fights
And if I do decide to grab the bull by the horns
It'll be to teach him to use em nice, to incite these soothing vibes
To keep you moving right on through the night
I'm not creative I just see places some haven't yet
An imaginative frantic head, and a passionate acumen for tapping pens
A palette wet with havoc and invasive crazies like George A. Romero's active set
"Lights camera action" said, with that attempt to pass a test
Can I invest my time as masterfully as I have in the past
And dress the canvas while I act possessed like Isaac Mendes
And step back and just ask if I've manifested and managed
To capture a handle on my craft, and hope the answer's yes
I'm mad, obsessed perhaps a drastic standard set but in my ideal work you can feel words
I'm Neil Peart with steel nerves beating my head on conundrums in a field search to yield worth
I'm influenced by authors and poets as much as music's might
I utilize my muses ideas to entice beautiful lines
I'll never choose to write aggressive stupid rhymes resembling useless fights
And if I do decide to grab the bull by the horns
It'll be to teach him to use em nice, to incite these soothing vibes
To keep you moving right on through the night
Some curtains are closed and drawn but my hope is not
I'm holding on, my sense of knowing strong, my future's close to wrought
Like Tobin's palm, I chase it like a homing dog, basset face, overall
I'll be over, all ears if you're a basket case woven wrong
With salt tears when life seems cloaked in flaws, if you need me just blow the horns
I'm influenced by authors and poets as much as music's might
I utilize my muses ideas to entice beautiful lines
I'll never choose to write aggressive stupid rhymes resembling useless fights
And if I do decide to grab the bull by the horns
It'll be to teach him to use em nice, to incite these soothing vibes
To keep you moving right on through the night
