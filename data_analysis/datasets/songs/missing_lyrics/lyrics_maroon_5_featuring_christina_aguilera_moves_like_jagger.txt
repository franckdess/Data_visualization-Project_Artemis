Oh
Oh

Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't needa try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

Baby, it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've got them moves like Jagger

Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Take me by the tongue)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (Yeah, yeah)
