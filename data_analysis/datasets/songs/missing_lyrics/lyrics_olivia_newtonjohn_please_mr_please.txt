In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox
With the best of country music, old and new
You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And somebody else's songs when your's are through
I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am, just missing you again
Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again
If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee
But I guess I'd better get myself together
Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said, "I'm sorry", by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind
Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again
