Never win first place, I don't support the team
I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me
I was always in a fight, 'cause I can't do nothing right

Everyday I fight a war against the mirror
I can't take the person staring back at me
I'm a hazard to myself

Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

I wanna be somebody else, yeah

LA told me, "You'll be a pop star
All you have to change is everything you are."
Tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears
She's so pretty, that just ain't me

So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?
A day in the life of someone else
'Cause I'm a hazard to myself

Don't let me get me (no)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating (no)
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else, yeah
Don't let me get me (don't let me)
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
So irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else

So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?
A day in the life of someone else
Don't let me get me

Oh, I'm a hazard to myself, yeah
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself (yourself)
So irritating (so irritating)
Don't wanna be my friend no more (don't, don't)
I wanna be somebody else
Don't let me get me
(Don't let, don't let)
I'm my own worst enemy
(Don't let me get me)
It's bad when you annoy yourself (it's bad, it's so bad)
So irritating (oh)
Don't wanna be my friend no more (ahh)
I wanna be somebody else

Don't let me get me
Don't let me get me
I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself
