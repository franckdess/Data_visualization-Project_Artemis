Hey, hey
Lord, Lord
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Freddie's dead
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan
Said he'd sing him home
But his hope was a rope
And he should've known

It's hard to understand
There was love in this man
I'm sure all would agree
That his misery
Was his woman and things
Now Freddie's dead --
That's what I said

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushin' dope for the man
A terrible blow
But that's how it goes
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you wanna be a junkie, well
Remember Freddie's dead

We're all built up with progress
But sometimes, I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But, reality -- what does it mean?
Ain't nothing said
'Cause Freddie's dead
Hey, hey
Lord, Lord
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha
Lord, Lord
Yeah, yeah!
Ha, ha
Yeah, yeah
Freddie's dead

All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl
Ooh, I need a woman child
Don't wanna be like Freddie, now
'Cause Freddie's dead
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
If you don't try
You're gonna die

Why can't we brothers
Protect one another?
No one's serious
And it makes me furious
Don't be misled
Just think of Fred

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushin' dope for the man
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you wanna be a junkie, well
Remember, Freddie's dead
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Freddie's dead
Hey, hey
Ha, ha
Lord, Lord
Ha, ha
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey
Lord, Lord
Hey, hey
