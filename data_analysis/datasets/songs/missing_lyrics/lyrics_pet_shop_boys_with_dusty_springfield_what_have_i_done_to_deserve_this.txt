You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I've always worked for a living
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?
I come here looking for money
(Got to have it)
And end up living with love, oh, oh
Now you left me with nothing
(Can't take it)
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?
I bought you drinks I brought you flowers
I read you books and talked for hours
Every day so many drinks
Such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...
Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through?
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through?
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much, oh
Now I can do what I want to - forever
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?
At night the people come and go
They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...
Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through? (tell me)
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through? (baby)
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through? (yeah)
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
Gonna get through?
Gonna get through?
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
I'm gonna get through, right?
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
You never ever left me, baby, think of me...
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
Oh, babe
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
Gonna get through, baby, I'm gonna get
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
Forever
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
Gonna get through, baby, yeah
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
Gonna get through, get through, baby, ooh
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
