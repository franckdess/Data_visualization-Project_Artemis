When the world
Wasn't upside down
I could take all
The time I had
But I'm not gonna wait
When a moment can
Vanish so fast
Cause every kiss
Is a kiss you
Can never get back
Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me this
Is what Heaven is
Well you'd be right
I've been waiting
Forever for this
This is the night
When the answer
To all my dreams
Is as close
As a touch away
Why am I here
Holding back
What I'm trying to say
Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me this
Is what Heaven is
Well you'd be right
Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you
To the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting
Forever for this
This is the night
This is the night
Where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight
We will never
Be lonely again
Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me this
Is what Heaven is
Well you'd be right
Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you
To the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting
Forever for this
This is the night
