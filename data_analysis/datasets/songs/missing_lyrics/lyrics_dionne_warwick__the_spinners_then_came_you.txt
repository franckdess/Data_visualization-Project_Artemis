Ever since I met you
Seems I can't forget you
The thought of you keeps
Running through the back of my mind
Every time I'm near you
I get that urge to feel you
Just touching you
And loving you makes everything right
(Tell me how you feel, baby)
I never knew love before
(Oh, no)
Then came you, you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
You
Now that I have found you
How did I live without you
(I don't know, baby)
It's plain to see
You're all I need to satisfy me
I'm so darned proud of you
I wanna sing about you
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, baby)
All I know
You made love grow
By touching my hand
Oh, uh-oh
I never knew love before
Then came you (you)
Then came you, ooh
I never knew love before
Then came you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Then came you
Hey, hey, hey
Then came you

Whoa, oh-uh-oh, oh-oh
I never knew love before
Then came you
Then came you
I never knew love before
Then came you (you, ooh-ooh)
Then came you
Whoa, oh-uh-oh, oh-oh
I never knew love before
Then came you (hey, hey)
Then came you, you
I never knew love before (hey)
Then came you
(With your loving touch) you
Ooh-ooh
Then came (yeah)
(Hey)
Oh-uh-no
I never knew love before
(I got to hand it to you, baby)
Then came you
