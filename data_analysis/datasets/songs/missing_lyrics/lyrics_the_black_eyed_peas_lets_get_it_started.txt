Let's get it started in here
And the bass keeps runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin, and runnin', runnin'
And

In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south

Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), just get into it (yeah), get stupid (come on)
Get it started, (come on) get it started (yeah), get it started

Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Yeah

Lose control, of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like an infant new kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we movin'

Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), just get into it (yeah), get stupid (come on)
Get it started, (come on) get it started (yeah), get it started

Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Yeah

Runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'

Ohh ohh ohh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

Let's get ill, that's the deal
At the gate, and we'll bring the bugged out drill (just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, twist and bang your spine (just)
Bob your head like me, apl.de
Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
Y'all mind pass normal on another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignant, let's get hectic

Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), just get into it (yeah), get stupid (come on)
Get it started, (come on) get it started (yeah), get it started

Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Yeah

Get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here
Let's get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here
Wild out, get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here
Ohh ohh ohh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
