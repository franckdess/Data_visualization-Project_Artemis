Sail on down the line
'Bout a half a mile or so
And don't really wanna know
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice you see
Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got
But now you're going

And I don't mind about the
Things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah

Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
All my friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that
A small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking

I gave you my heart and
I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time, yeah

Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good

Sail on
Sail on
Sail on
