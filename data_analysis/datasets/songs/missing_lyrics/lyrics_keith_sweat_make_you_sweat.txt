Ooh baby, give it to me now, girl, yeah

There's nobody here, baby
But me and you, yeah, girl
I wanna pull down the shade, dim the lights
And do what I wanna do to you, yeah girl
Don't tell me no, baby
I think you're trying to play hard to get, girl
Oh girl, before the night is over
I bet, I bet I can make you sweat

You say no, I say yes
Girl, I bet, I can make you sweat
You say no, I say yes
Girl, I bet, I can make you sweat

And baby that's what I wanna do
Just put your arms in the air
Let me kiss ya everywhere

You say no, I say yes
Girl, I bet, I can make you sweat
You say no, I say yes
Girl, I bet, I can make you sweat
