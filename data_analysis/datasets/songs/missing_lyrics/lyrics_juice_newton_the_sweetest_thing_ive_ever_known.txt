When I see you in the morning
That old sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter
And the tears we shared last night

And as we lie here, just two shadows
In the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores

And all the heartaches and temptations
Only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you


The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you
