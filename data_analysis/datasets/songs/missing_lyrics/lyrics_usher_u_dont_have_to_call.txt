Yo, after tonight...
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh
Come on, that's how it's going down
You smell it? Hah yeah
You smell it? Hah yeah
Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh

Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it

Meanwhile I...
I loved you, you were my girl
You see, I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby

You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Aw, girl, your face is saying, "Why?"
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me, listening to friends
Now it's the end
And again, no story can end without it

Damn right...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see, I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby

You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay, girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

Gonna boogie, tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waiting for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party, yeah, oh yeah

You don't have to call (you don't gotta call)
It's okay, girl (It's okay, girl)
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight (I'ma be alright hah)
