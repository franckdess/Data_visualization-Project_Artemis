Say, say, say what you want
But don't play games with my affection
Take, take, take what you need
But don't leave me with no direction

All alone, I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby (baby)
Through the years, how can you stand to hear
My pleading for you?
You know I'm crying oo oo oo oo oo
Yeah, yeah

Now go, go, go where you want
But don't leave me here forever
You, you, you, stay away
So long girl, I see you never

What can I do, girl, to get through to you?
Cause I love you, baby (baby)
Standing here, baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years, you know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo
(You've got to say, say, say
You've got to say, say, say...)

You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You're saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face these tears ain't drying

You, you, you, can never say
That I'm not the one who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray, everyday
That you'll see things, girl, like I do

What can I do, girl, to get through to you
Cause I love you, baby (love you / baby)
Standing here, baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years, you know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo

Oo oo oo oo oo (say, say, say)
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oh baby
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oh baby
Oh baby
(Oo oo oo, oo oo oo, oo oo ooo...)
Oh baby
(Oo oo oo, oo oo oo, oo oo ooo...)
Oh baby
Oh baby
Say, say, say (Say, say, say)
Oo oo oo say, say, say, Oo oo oo say, say, say...
Come on
(Say, say, say, Say, say, say, Say, say, say...)
Come on
Oo oo oo say, say, say, Oo oo oo say, say, say
Oo oo oo yeah, yeah, yeah, Oo oo oo yeah, yeah, yeah
Oo oo oo say, say, say, Oo oo oo say, say, say...
Oo oo oo
Say, say, say
Oo oo oo (come on)
(Say, say, say)
