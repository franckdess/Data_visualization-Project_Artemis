Rock
Rock steady

I looked at you
You stole my heart
You were all that I anticipated
I wanted you
Every part
But I knew love would be complicated
I begin to touch
But you wouldn’t let it
It never seemed to be the right time
I started to give up
Down to the limit
And then you changed your mind, whoa

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rocking all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn
Rock (ooh)
Steady
Steady rocking all night long
Rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn

You looked at me
To my surprise
You were too anticipating
I should have known
It was in your eyes
That you were getting tired of waiting
You wanted me so much
But I didn’t get it
How could a fellow be so blind?
I started to give up
But love wouldn’t let it
Then you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rocking all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn
Rock (ooh)
Steady
Steady rocking all night long
(All night long)
Rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn
(Rocking till the break of dawn)
Ooh, dooba, dooba, da
Rock
(Steady, baby, rock steady, baby)
Ooh, rock
(Steady, baby, rock steady, baby)
Rock
Ooh, rock

You wanted me so much
But I didn’t get it
How could a fellow be so blind?
I started to give up
But love wouldn’t let it
Then you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rocking all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn
(Rocking till the break of dawn)
Rock (Ooh)
Steady
Steady rocking all night long
(All night long)
Rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn
(Everybody)
Rock (steady rock)
Steady
(St-st-st-steady rock)
Steady rocking all night long
(Everybody steady rocking)
Rock steady
Rocking till the break of dawn
(Rocking till the break of dawn)
(Everybody steady rocking)
