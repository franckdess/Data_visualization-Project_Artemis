They calling me to come back to the streets
Sean P., aka "A Sharp Crease"
Said it was necessary, these sucka niggas out here very scary
They cuffing hoes, they living in the month of February
OK then, put a sissy nigga on display then
Kick in your door and have my folks bring them K's in
I'm still Attic A-double T-I-C
It ain't a hoe out there, for real, who don't know bout me
Bitch I'm for sure with it
Don't make me pop that trunk to the 'Lac
Bitch I will go get it
And I ain't selfish, I will let you and your ho feel it
Won't catch me sipping on no Cris and got a cold belly
It's Youngbloodz A-Town malt liquor sipping
Coming straight from the gutter
Toe-tag a motherfucker, leave them under a cover
Lil John he drop the beat that make you bounce like rubber
Sean Paul he tote the heat to make you mug then slug ya, yeah

I post up get to it, drink hand in hand
They call me Mr. Herringbone cause that's my right hand man
Old-school straight foolish like no other indeed
With Lil Jon, it's YoungbloodZ, they crunk as can be
Attic Crew 105 that's if you looking to rumble
Cock back bust aim now I done got your number
In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder
Cause in the Dirty we them boys that drank you under the table
Where them niggas pimp hoes in fly suits and gators
In my Chevy so super I'm the one to call
Just dial 1-800-430 slash ALCOHOL
And dog I'm not the one that you really just wanna clown
I'm cool in my way, but shit still I shut them down
And piss on them haters J-Bo he cuts a fool
In the cut bout slizzard somewhere that's how we do

If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (Hey!)

Out of town hard heads get Swiss cheesed up
And you gonna need more than stitches to patch that leak up
Chump like me up my mouth TB'd up
With the plush leather guts steady gripping the butt
Oh you for sure with it, then pull your pistol
Show a nigga you ain't hoe with it
And I ain't selfish I will let you and your folk feel it
Talking big-boy shit
Mean mugging like a motherfucker, my hand on my dick

Cause off the rip we keep it jumping like it ain't nothing new
We started off with Shake Em Off so look partner, oh guess who?
It's them boys from the bottom who took you down 85
And hit you with that U-Way so look here don't be surprised
We bucking, blowing, chilling and sipping on something good
I'm peeping out the scenery, wishing a nigga would
In case it just might pop off I'm ready to lock and load
To take you through the South to show you how we throw them bows

If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (Hey!)
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (Hey!)
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (Hey!)
If you don't give a damn, we don't give a fuck (Hey!)
