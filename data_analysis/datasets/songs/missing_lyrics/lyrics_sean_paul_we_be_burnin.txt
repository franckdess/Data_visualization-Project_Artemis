Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin' yo
Gyal a make we please and we be thuggin' now
Sipping Hennessy and we be bubblin' yo
Set yuh mind at ease we gotta take it slow
So when you see the S.P. floating don't provoke him
Cause the girls we be poking ganja smoking
Best thing for the recreation to get the best girls in every nation
Topper girls we promotin' and supportin'
And them love how we flow king hear them shouting
First class ticket invitation gyal from New York, England and Jamaican
Everyday

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin' dollars turning cah' we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds, girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, pimpin' as we riding

Girls them a page me want to raise me
True me write enough tune and drive them crazy
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready fi di girls them in every situation
We a the gyal them pro, them know we flow
With the lyrical content that make them dip low and
Make the club keep jumpin'
Turn up the bass when you hear this pumpin'
Summertime bounce to the music people choose it
Sean the P gal a cruise with... well reputed
Cause we a the girls them champion
Got 'nuff a dem like the great king Solomon
Many girls in a with eye sight sexy dress type
Se them ready for a hype night
Just gimme the light
An make we blaze it the roof we haffi raise it again

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say
We be earnin' dollars turning cah' we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds, girls, we need them everyday

Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin' yo
Gyal a make we please and we be thuggin' now
