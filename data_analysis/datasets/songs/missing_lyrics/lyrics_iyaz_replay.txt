Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (ayy!)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay (J-J-J-JR), replay

Remember the first time we met?
You was at the mall wit' yo' friend
I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again

That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, is a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
And she's running through my mind all day, ayy

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn'
Girl, you really changed my life
Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin' things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, is a dime they say (Hey)
That girl, is a gun to my holster
And she's running through my mind all day, ayy

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay (Oh)
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl, let's sing with me, ayy
I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me, ayy
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-naa
Shawty got me singin'
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-naa
Now she got me singin'

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay (Ayy)
Shawty's like a melody in my head (Like a melody)
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like (Hey, ayy)
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
