Please come now I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, "Heaven save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down
I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's
Something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's
Something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

Please come now I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
