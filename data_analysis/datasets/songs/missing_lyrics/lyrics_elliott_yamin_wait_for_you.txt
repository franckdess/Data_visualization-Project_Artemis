I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So, baby, I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So, baby, I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you

So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside
This is not how you want it to be

Baby, I will wait for you
Baby, I will wait for you if it's the last thing I do
Baby, I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting
