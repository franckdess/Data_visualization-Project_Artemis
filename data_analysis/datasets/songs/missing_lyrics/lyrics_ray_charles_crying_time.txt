Oh, it's crying time again, you're going to leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling, oh
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
(Fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger
(Stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's crying time again, you're going to leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling, yeah now
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Now you say you've found someone that you love better
(Better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
('Morrow)
Crying time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's crying time again, you're going to leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling, oh right now
That it won't be long before it's crying time

That it won't be long before it's crying time
