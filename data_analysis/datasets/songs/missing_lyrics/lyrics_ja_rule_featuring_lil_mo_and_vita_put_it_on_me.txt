Where would I be without you?

Where would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a, part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (baby)
When you cry who wipes your tears
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl, put it on me

Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)
Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy put it on me

Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)
Where would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (put it on me)

Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cause every thug needs a lady (yeah, yeah)
I feel you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears there be no more crying (baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl put it on me
