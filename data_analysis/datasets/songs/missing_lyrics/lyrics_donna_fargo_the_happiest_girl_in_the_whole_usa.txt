Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Good morning morning
Hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move that bojangle clock so far away from the bed
Just one more minute
That's why we moved it
One more hug would do
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you
You make the coffee
I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch
And you fix mine
Now tell me the truth
Do these old shoes look funny
Honey it's almost nine
Now you be careful
Gotta go, I love you
Have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Skippidity do da
Thank you oh Lord for making him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be
There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Now shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skippidity do da day
I'm the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A
