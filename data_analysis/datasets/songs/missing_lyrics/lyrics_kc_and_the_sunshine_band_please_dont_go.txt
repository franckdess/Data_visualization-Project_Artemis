Yeah
Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
So please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay
If you leave, at least in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you
So please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay
Hey, hey, hey

That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
So please don't go

Beggin' please, please, please
