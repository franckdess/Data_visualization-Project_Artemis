I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Goin' 95 burning down 129 yeah
Looking for the law, while push my luck
She's ridin' shot gun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Pull into the party like "y'all wassup"
Tonight is bottoms up up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin' at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up up
Tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up up up
Damn girl I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song would make you move like that yeah
And she's doing it in daisy dukes
Girl she's got ya tappin' on a boys shoulder
Hey dog check this out
And that's how girl do it in the dirty south yeah
She'll have you on your knee "can I marry you?"

Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama lookin' at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up up up
Tonight is bottoms up up up
Get 'em up get 'em up get 'em up

Bottoms up

Let's give a toast to the good times
All y'all get your drinks up high
Everybody feelin' all right
Damn right
'Cause tonight it's bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet, little country town
Get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
