I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems

When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through

And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

Whoa, whoa
Oh, I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to

I run to you, I run to you, yeah
Whoa, whoa
Oh, I run to you
I run to you, girl
Whoa, whoa, mmm

I always run to you
Run to you
Run to you
