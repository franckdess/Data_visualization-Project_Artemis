Open up, open up
And let the funk flow in
From this nigga name J and his new found friend
I'm hitting switches like Eric on the solo creep
For yo jeep it's the B.R.A.T
Putting the dip in your hip from right to left
It's the ghetto ass bitch and I'm So So Def
Nigga that's my click, nigga that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fat shit
Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
With the real shit, we got the shit you can't funk with
(Why?)
Because we so funkdafied
(Why?)
We make you move from side to side
Well, it's da G H da E T T O, nigga
Brat and J.D. coming like that big baby
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimping
And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson

So, So, So Funkdafied

Puttin' it down, puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes the Brat tat-tat-tat
I got the shit to make your neck snap back
Meaning I got the shit that a get'cha bent
Tear the roof off this mutha like Parliament
I'm on a roll In Control like Janet, dammit
Brat, you're the funk bandit and they can't handle it
I know, that's why I keep hitting em with this grammar
Letting niggas know that I'm the real mama jama
Straight to the head like a chronic sack

I pass the mic to the Brat
And yo I passed it back
Well, a sistas and fellas
It's time to get your groove on
I provide the funkdafied sounds that make yo move, homes
Breaking these fools off proper like
It's S.O. S.O. D.E.F. dynamite
Humunah, humunah, comin' up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we coming at cha
Baby we can't miss
There's a new Tag Team in town
Nigga, Whoomp, there it is
