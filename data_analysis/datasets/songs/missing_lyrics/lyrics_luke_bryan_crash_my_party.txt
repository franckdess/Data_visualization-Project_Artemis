It don't matter what plans I've got, I can break 'em
Yeah I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind tellin' all the guys I can't meet 'em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl I don't care, oh I just gotta see what you're wearin'
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down
Oh I just have to see it now 

If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kinda thing
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime

Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone, so long, hang on
I'll meet you in a minute or two

If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kinda thing
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime

If it's two in the mornin' and you're feelin' lonely
And wonderin' what I'm doin'
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kinda thing
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime
Baby you can crash my party anytime
