As the midnight moon, was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine
Seein' what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind
I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooo, we got the time
Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh ooh ooh
If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind
Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I've got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
I found a lover with a slow hand
Ooo, a lover with a slow hand
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush
Ooh, lover with a slow hand
