Girl you messed up when you let me in
Told your best friend that you wanted me
Then she called me up and hipped me to your steez
Told me that you were lookin' for a guy like me
So I said hold on, I ain't the one
Unless shorty really wanna have some fun
Then she said that you told her I was what you want
When I call you don't try to front(uh huh)

I'm the guy in your dreams (that you had last night)
I'm the benz wit tha 20'z (that you wanna drive)
I'm tha thug in your life (that'll treat you right)
Got ya hooked cuz I'm bringing everything you like

Uh huh

Uh huh

And maybe we can roll wit it

Now we're all out in the open
Everybody knows about you and me
Ain't no more need for you and me to creep
I want you so bad I don't care who sees
So girl hold on, I got what you want
I know you ain't scared to go n have some fun
So let your girlfriends know that you found someone
Who'll be keepin' you tight and sprung (uh huh)

I'm tha guy in your dreams (that you had last night)
I'm benz wit tha 20's (that you wanna drive)
I'm tha thug in your life (that'll treat you right)
Got ya hooked coz I'm bringing everything you like


Two months of conversation
Man it's a major
Split tha game undercover
I'm lethal like Danny Glover
Got you runnin' to your mother
Makin' plans for life
Yo, I'm only 15 what I need wit a wife?
We can walk through tha mall while I hold ya hips
Or you can hang out tha drop while I'm pushin' tha whip
Take you on a ride you will never forget
Runnin' home, tellin' your friends lil' Fizz is it
Got ya hooked by tha way that I lick my lips
And I got many dimes, I ain't sweatin' dis chick
Yo, I run these girls from coast to coast
Dropin' game so sick I got 'em doin' tha most (uh huh)
