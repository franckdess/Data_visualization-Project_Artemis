And I'm really geeked up
And I got mo' dro'

But yo laffy taffy got me cold (oh)
Gone get loose (oh)

Waddle, stop you watchin' me
Laffy taffy I'm likin' this
Big ole ass you shakin' bitch
Close yo mouth and don't say shit
Bend on ova and hit a split
Work that pole and work it well
Stacks on deck, yo ankles swell
Girl, lemme touch ya

Security guard don't scare nobody
Damn right I touched that ho
All the money just hit the flo'

Say baby girl
Ay what you gon' do
I got a hundred ones
I wanna po' on you
Just keep that ass shakin'
And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a playa
And sip that grey goose
Feelin' all loose
Cause girl you on yo job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes
Workin' them micros
On the stilletos
You made it skeet skeet skeet
Like a water hose (candy girl)
Got me goin' in my pocket pullin' out mo' dough
Let the waitress know I need to order, five hundred mo'
You best believe later on we headed to the mo'
So gone and pack them bags
And let's motherfuckin' go
I'm waitin' on yo fine ass
At the front do'
Girl, you don't know

Toss it, flip it, and slap it
Bust a couple of nuts
And get right back at it
