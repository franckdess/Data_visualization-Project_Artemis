First thing
Monday morning
I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back
I'm looking for me a better day

You see
The thing 'bout love is
That it's not enough
If the only thing it brings you is pain
There comes a time
When we could all make a change, darling

Just let go
And let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right
You know
(Just let go)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go, baby

Don't nobody want no broke heart
And don't nobody
Want no two-time losers, oh no
Ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way
Oh, no, no, no

You see
The thing of it is we deserve respect
But we can't demand respect without change
There comes a time
When we must go our own way

Just let go
And let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right
You know
(Just let go)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go, baby

Cause sometimes love
It can work out right
Sometimes you'll never know
But if it brings you only pain in your life
Don't be afraid to let it go

Just let go
And let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right
You know
(Just let go)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow
Just let it go, baby

I wanna thank God
(Just let go)
And let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow
Everything's gonna work out right
You know
(Just let go, let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow)
Just let it go
(Just let go, let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow)
Let it flow
Let it flow
(Just let go, let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow)
Let it flow, let it flow
