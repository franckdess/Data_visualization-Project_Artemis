Ahhh... Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
You’ve got to show me love

Heartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share
I’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere
What I need is somebody who really cares
I really need a lover, a lover who wants to be there
It’s been so long since I touched a wanting hand
I can’t put my love on the line, that I hope you’ll understand

So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You’ve got to show me love

I’m tired of getting caught up in those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody who will always be there
Don’t you promise me the world, all that I’ve already heard
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words
If you’re looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You’ve got to show me love

Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby
Heartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share
I’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere
What I really need is somebody who will always be there
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words
If you’re looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You’ve got to show me love
There’s nothing that you can tell me
You’ve got to show me love
There’s only one key to my heart
You’ve got to show me love
