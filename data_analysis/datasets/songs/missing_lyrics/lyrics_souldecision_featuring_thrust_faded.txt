When I get you all alone
I'm gonna take off all your clothes
Ain't nobody gonna interrupt my game, oh, no, no
Ever since you've been hangin' 'round
I've been tryin' to figure out
What I can say to you to get some play, yeah

Couldn't we do what we did last night again?
Baby, you and I'd be better friends
Don't you think it's time we went a bit further? Oh yeah
Every night when we say goodbye
How can I help looking in your eyes?
Wondering why that you and I haven't hit it
Can we get it on?

I'm kind of faded, but I feel alright
Thinking about making my move tonight
I can't pretend that you're only my friend when you're holding my body tight
'Cause I like the way you're making your move
I like the way you're making me wait
At the end of the night, when I make up your mind
You'll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you know you got it
And you know I want it
I can't wait to take you home (You know you've got it tonight)
I don't wanna be rude at all
I just wanna be where you go
Think what we could do alone (Yeah)

Uh, uh, when we first met, yo, that deal was stated
You stepped like my steez the way we conversated
Just another day
Just around the way
Put me up close with everything okay
'Cause I'm-
Not like the rest
Indescision with the best
Thoughts for my full court press
Just because they hated
How's it go? HA, yo faded

I'm kind of faded, but I feel alright
