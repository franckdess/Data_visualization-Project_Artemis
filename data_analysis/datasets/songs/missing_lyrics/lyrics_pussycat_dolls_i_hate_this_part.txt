We're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

I can't take it any longer (can't take this)
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers (it's slipping through our fingers)
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye (goodbye now)
To find a way that I can tell you

That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

Oh, I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here
