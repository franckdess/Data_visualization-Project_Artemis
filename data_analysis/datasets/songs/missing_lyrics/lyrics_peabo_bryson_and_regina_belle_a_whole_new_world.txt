I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess, now when did you last
Let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

Oh

A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
(Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, red letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
(Anywhere) There's time to spare
(Let me share)
This whole new world with you

A whole new world (A whole new world)
That's where we'll be (Where we will be)
A thrilling chase (A wondrous place)
For you and me
