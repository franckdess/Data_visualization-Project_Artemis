You got me twisted thinking about the way that things use to be
When it was you and me girl I was so free, see
You had my heart from the start like Cupid
And I was just downright foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can’t even concentrate
I guess I’ll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted

(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby
(You know you want my lovin') You know, I can make you feel real good if you let me baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby
(You know you want my lovin') You know you want my lovin' baby
