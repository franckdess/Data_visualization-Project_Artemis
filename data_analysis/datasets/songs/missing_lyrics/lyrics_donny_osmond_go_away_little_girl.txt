Go away, little girl
Go away, little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
I'm dating somebody else
I must be true
Oh, go away little girl
Go away, little girl
It's hurting me more each minute that we delay
When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay
Go away, little girl
Go away, little girl
It hurts me more the more that we delay
When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away, little girl
Let's call it a day, little girl
Please, go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay
