Hey, can you tell when you look in my eye
You don't mess around with me
'Less you feelin' dangerous
Are you into my scene, lay it on the line
Ya come and take a walk with me
If you're feelin' dangerous
Because I'm meaner, I'm leaner
I ain't no in-betweener
With a reefer, I'm a dreamer
Good God, I'm a believer

Maybe we can shake it down by the walk
Do you think I'm takin' liberties?
Are ya dangerous?
I've gotta let it, somethin' in my jeans
Ya come and take a walk with me
If you're feelin' dangerous
Because I'm meaner, I'm leaner
I ain't no in-betweener
With a reefer, I'm a dreamer
Good God, I'm a believer
