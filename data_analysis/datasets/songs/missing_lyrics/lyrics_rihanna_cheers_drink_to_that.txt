Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don’t let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round

Everybody put your glasses up, and I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

Life’s too short to be sitting around miserable
People gonna talk whether you doing bad or good, yeah
Got a drink on my mind, and my mind on my money, yeah
Looking so bomb, gonna find me a honey

Got my Ray-Bans on and I’m feeling hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody’s vibing, so don’t nobody start a fight, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
