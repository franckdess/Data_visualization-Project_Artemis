You're a doll
Your eyes see it all
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Wanna see me
You're so young
But your feelings are deep
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Feel for me
You put your head on my pillow
And you're fast asleep
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Dream about me
Ooh, ooh, baby
The world's a wall of ice
You're gonna need someone
To treat you warm
And keep you nice
I like the way you dance
The way you spin
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Spin for me
You put your head on my pillow
And you're fast asleep
And how do I make you
How do I make you
How do I make you
Dream about me
Dream about me
Dream about me, woo
Dream about me
Dream about me, woo
Dream about me
Dream about me, woo
Dream about me
Dream about me
