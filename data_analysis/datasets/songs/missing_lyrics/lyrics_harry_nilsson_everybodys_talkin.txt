Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind
People stoppin', starin'
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Wohm, wohm, wohm, wohm
Wohm, wohm, wohm, wohm, wohm
Wohm

I'm going where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
Can't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

I won't let you leave my love behind
No I won't let you leave
Wohm, wha, ah
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave
