I won't see your smile
And I won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night I won't see you walk
Through that door
'Cause time wasn't on your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know

Oh, baby, no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby

Now baby, can you hear me?
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me?
I need you to be by my side
'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you?
God knows I need you to know

Oh, baby, no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby

Somewhere I know you'll be with me
Someday in another time
But right now you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
Oh, you will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
No, I'll never forget you (No, baby, no, baby)
I'll never let you out of my heart
Oh, you will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
No, I'll never forget you (No, baby, no, baby)
I'll never let you out of my heart
(Never, never, never, never, never)
