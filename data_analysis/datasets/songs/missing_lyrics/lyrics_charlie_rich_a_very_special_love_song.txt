Babe, somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, babe
It'll have my love behind it
And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me
A Very Special Love Song
And babe, if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it babe
If there's a melody I'll play it
I'll play it through especially for you and all the words are true
A Very Special Love Song
So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it
'Cause I'm goin' to sing it to the whole big lonely world
So turn your radio way down low and get near it
And I'll tell the world I love you, girl
Babe, if there's an ounce of love I'm gonna give it to you
Babe, if there's a breath of life I'm gonna live it every day for you
And all the whole night through, singin' just for you
