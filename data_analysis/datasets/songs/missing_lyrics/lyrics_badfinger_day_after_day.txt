I remember findin' out about you
Every day, my mind is all around you

Lookin' out from my lonely room, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember holdin' you while you sleep
Every day I feel the tears that you weep

Lookin' out of my lonely gloom, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you


Lookin' out of my lonely room, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember findin' out about you
Every day my mind is all around you

Lookin' out of my lonely gloom, day after day
Bring it home, baby, make it soon
I give my love to you
