How long you gonna carry on
This one on one charade?
Let's don't and then say we did
That's the game you like to play
Ooh, we've been through this so many times
The end result's always the same
I always end up complaining
When I've got myself to blame

You're just a dead giveaway, yeah
You'd think I'd learn to handle this by now
You're just a dead giveaway (dead giveaway)
Girl, you can't deny it (Even though you try), oh oh
You keep trying to hide it (Baby, we know why)
I get a call about 2 a.m
Saying you don't wanna be alone
I'm tired and half asleep
But emotions are just a little too strong
Oo, I figured that I'd call your bluff
'Cause you want me to come on by
Girl, you know it's your love I've always wanted
But this time I won't be denied

'Cause you're a dead giveaway, hey
You want me like I want you
You're just a dead giveaway (dead giveaway)
You're scared but you won't admit it (Even though you try), ooh yeah
But tonight you're committed (baby, we know why)
'Cause you're just a dead giveaway
A dead giveaway
You're not that na√Øve, girl (I'm finding out), ooh ooh
Is playing deceiver (what you're all about?)
Dead giveaway
Dead giveaway
Girl, you can't deny it (even though you try), ooh ooh, baby
You keep trying to hide it (baby, we know why)
Well, now that you're serious
It's time to take off that disguise
You want more that mental stimulation
I can see it in your eyes
Oo, for years I've been your analyst
I've been as patient as I've been kind
For years you've played off believing
That I loved you for only your mind

You're just a dead giveaway
Girl, you want me like I want you
Dead giveaway

Dead giveaway
You've been holding back for too long
You're a dead giveaway (dead giveaway)
You're scared but you won't admit it (even though you try), oo oh
But tonight you are committed (baby, we know why)
'Cause you're a dead giveaway
I can tell by the look in your eyes
A dead giveaway (dead giveaway)
I'm finding out
What you're all about?
You're just a dead giveaway
