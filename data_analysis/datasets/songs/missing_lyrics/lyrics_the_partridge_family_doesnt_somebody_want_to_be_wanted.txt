I go downtown
And roam around
But every street I walk I find another dead end
I'm on my own but I'm so all alone
I need somebody
So I won't have to pretend

I know there's someone just waiting somewhere
I look around for her but she's just not there
Ohh

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?
Where are you?
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?

I'm runnin' free but I don't want to be
I couldn't take another day
Like yesterday
I'm dead on my feet
From walkin' the street
I need somebody
To help me find my way

I've gotta get out of this town (out of this town)
Before I do I'll take a last look around
Ohh

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?
Where are you?
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?

You know, I'm no different from anybody else
I start each day and end each night
It gets really lonely when you're by yourself
And where is love? And who is love?
I gotta know

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?
Where are you?
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?
Heyyy

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?
Where are you?
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?
Heyyy

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me?
Where are you?
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me?
Heyyy
