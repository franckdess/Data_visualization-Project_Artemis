Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night, I dream of love so true

Just another night, another vision of love
You feel joy, you feel pain, 'cause nothing will be the same
Just another night, is all that it takes
To understand, the difference between lovers and fakes
So baby, I talk talk, I talk to you
In the night, in your dream, of love so true
I talk talk, I talk to you
In the night, in your dream, of love so true

In the night, in my dreams, I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone, I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night, I dream of love so true


Just another night, another dream, another vision
Of love, with me
I'm here to set you free
I am your lover, your brother
Hey sister, let me cover, your body with my love is with my lovin' just another
Vision of love, that seems to be true
All we do, all the things that only lovers do
Vision of love, that seems to be true
All we do, all the things that only lovers do

In the night, in my dreams, I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone, I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night, I dream of love so true

I talk talk, I talk to you
In the night, in your dream, of love so true
I talk talk, I talk to you, in the night, in your dream, of love so true

In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone, I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night, I dream of love so true
