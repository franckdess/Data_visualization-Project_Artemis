Bag lady you gone hurt your back
Dragging all them bags like that
I guess nobody ever told you
All you must hold onto
Is you, is you, is you
One day all them bags gone get in your way
One day all them bags gone get in your way
I said one day all them bags gone get in your way
One day all them bags gone get in your way
So pack light
Ooh Ooh
Bag Lady you gone miss your bus
You can't hurry up
'Cause you got too much stuff
When they see you coming
Niggas take off running
From you it's true, oh yes they do
One day he gone say you crowding my space
One day he gone say you crowding my space
I said one day he gone say you crowding my space
One day he gone say you crowding my space
So pack light
Ooh Ooh
Girl I know sometimes it's hard
And we can't let go
Oh when someone hurts you oh so bad inside
You can't deny it you can't stop crying
So oh, oh, oh
If you start breathin
