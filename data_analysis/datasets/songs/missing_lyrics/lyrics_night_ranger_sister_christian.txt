Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say, okay
Where you going, what you looking for
You know those boys don't want to play no more with you
It's true

You're motoring, what's your price for flight?
In finding Mister Right
You'll be alright tonight

Babe, you know you're growing up so fast
And mama's worrying that you won't last
To say, let's play
Sister Christian, there's so much in life
Don't you give it up before your time is due
It's true
It's true, yeah

Motoring
What's your price for flight?
You've got him in your sight
And driving through the night


You're motoring, what's your price for flight?
In finding Mister Right
You'll be alright tonight


Motoring
What's your price for flight?
You've got him in your sight
And driving through the night
Motoring, what's your price for flight?
In finding Mister Right
You'll be alright tonight

Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say, okay
But you're motoring
Yeah, motoring
