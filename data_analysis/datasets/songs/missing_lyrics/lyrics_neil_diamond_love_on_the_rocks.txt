Love on the rocks, ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose, so you just sing the blues
All the time
Gave you my heart, gave you my soul
You left me alone here with nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone, now all I want
Is a smile
First they say they want you, indeed how they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there walking in a storm
And when they know they have you then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say, you've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
You need what you need, you can say what you want
Not much you can do when the feeling is gone
Maybe blue skies above, but it's cool
When your love's on the rocks
First they say they want you, indeed how they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there walking in a storm
And when they know they have you then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say, you've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks, ain't no big surprise
Just pour me a drink and I'll tell you more lies
Yesterday's gone, now all I want
Is a smile
