We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But there's no one left at home, and I believe I'm gonna rain

We're so sorry, but we haven't heard a thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But if anything should happen, we'll be sure to give a ring

We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But we haven't done a bloody thing all day
We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
But the kettle's on the boil and we're so easily called away

Admiral Halsey notified me
He had to have a berth or he couldn't get to sea
I had another look, and I had a cup of tea and a butter pie (Butter pie?)
(The butter wouldn't melt so I put it in the pie, alright?)

Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
Live a little, be a gypsy, get around (Get around)
Get your feet up off the ground
Live a little, get around
