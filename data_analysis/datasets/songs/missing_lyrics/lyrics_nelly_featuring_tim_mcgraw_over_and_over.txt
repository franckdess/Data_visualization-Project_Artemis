Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it no

I can't wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before, we, said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing
Over and over again
Ho, but I think, she's leavin'
Aw, man, she's leavin'
And, I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
Yeah, and I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it no

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin' in my head
Over and over again play in my head
Over and over again
Ho, I think, she's leavin'
Aw, man, she's leavin'
And, I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, and I can't shake it no

Now, that I've realized
That I'm goin' down
From all this pain you've put me through
Everytime I close my eyes (woo)
I lock it down, ohh-hooo
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, no I can't shake it no

Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, over and over again, over and over again
'Cause it's all in my head
