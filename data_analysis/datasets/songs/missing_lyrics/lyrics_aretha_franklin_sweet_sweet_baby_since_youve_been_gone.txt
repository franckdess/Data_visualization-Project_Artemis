Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way
Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will
I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue
Since you've been gone, ah baby
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone, yeah
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, baby
Hey hey, hear me, hear me now
(Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do
(Hear me)
Yeah, to get you back somehow
(Hear me now)
And I'm trying
Take me back
Consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
But I've just been so blue
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Hey baby, since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Yeah now, I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Baby, since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Yeah now, and I've been so lonely
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Hey baby, since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Yeah, baby baby baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby
Since you've been gone, yeah now
(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)
Baby baby baby baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby
Since you've been gone, yeah
