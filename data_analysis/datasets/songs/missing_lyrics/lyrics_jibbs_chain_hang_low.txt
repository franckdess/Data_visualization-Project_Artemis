Beasta!

Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you through it over your shoulder
If ya hot it'd make ya cold?
Do yo chain hang low?

Is that ya chain?
Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride 'n' let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name
Is that ya chain?
Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride 'n' let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name
I'm off the chain

Yea, yea, yea, yea, I'm hot kid
Chain so low you would think the diamonds never stopped it
And its funny cause you could never stop it
Bunch of rocks on my hand and I ain't even on the block kid
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my timbs
And the chain hang 24 inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up (yea) sorta like a pimp
So when the light hit the ice it starts glistenin' off the tip
My chain hang, all it do is bling-bling
(Half) blue, (half) red, like my diamonds gang-bang
And I don't even think we on the same thang
Yo I'm so heavy they couldn't lift it till the crane came (yea)

Yea, yea, yea, yea, I'm so icy
Charm so heavy that my neck don't like me
Gone, and no, no, no, its not a game
I'll throw my chain in the crowd like dang these (this is nothin')
Diamonds is nothin' to me
Especially when I'm dressin' up, its just a button to me (bling)
And not to mention my T's
Cuz they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (alright, thanx)
So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, and blue like the American flag (its so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
So much money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream
Give you a black eye cause of the beating
They think I am a mutant the way ya boy is beasting
I stay winning some time, you'll call it cheating
And my boys always around like it's a meeting
