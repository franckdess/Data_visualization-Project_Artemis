Trapped in a mine what had caved in
And everyone knows the only ones left
Were Joe and me and Tim
When they broke through to pull us free
The only ones left to tell the tale
Was Joe and me
Timothy, Timothy
Where on earth did you go?
Timothy, Timothy
God why don't I know?
Hungry as hell no food to eat
And Joe said that he would sell his soul
For just a piece of meat
Water enough to drink for two
And Joe said to me, 'I'll take a swig
And then there's some for you.'
Timothy, Timothy
Joe was looking at you
Timothy, Timothy
God, what did we do?
I must've blacked out just 'bout then
'Cause the very next thing that I could see
Was the light of the day again
My stomach was full as it could be
And nobody ever got around
To finding Timothy
Timothy, Timothy
Where on earth did you go?
Timothy, Timothy
God, why don't I know?
Timothy
Yeah
Timothy
Timothy
Yeah
Timothy
