I don't care, about your past
I just want, our love to last
I don't care, darling, about your faults
I just want to satisfy your pulse

When you kiss me
When you miss me
Hold my hand
Make me understand
I break out - in a cold sweat

I don't care about your wants
I just wanna, tell ya about the do's and don'ts
I don't care, about the way you treat me darling
I just want, you to understand me honey


Maceo
C'mon now
Brother
Put it, put it where it's at now
Let me have it...
