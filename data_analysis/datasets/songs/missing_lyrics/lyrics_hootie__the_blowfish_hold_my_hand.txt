With a little love, and some tenderness
We'll walk upon the water, we'll rise above the mess
With a little peace, and some harmony
We'll take the world together, we'll take 'em by the hand

'Cause I've got a hand for you
'Cause I wanna run with you

Yesterday, I saw you standing there
Your head was down, your eyes were red, no comb had touched your hair
I said get up, and let me see you smile
We'll take a walk together, walk the road awhile, 'cause

'Cause I've got a hand for you
(I've got a hand for you)
'Cause I wanna run with you
(Won't you let me run with you? Yeah)

(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be
(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can

See I was wasted, and I was wastin' time
'Til I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes
Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud
I don't wanna be part of your problems, don't wanna be part of your crowd, no

'Cause I've got a hand for you
(I've got a hand for you)
'Cause I wanna run with you
(Ah, won't you let me run with you?)

(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to the promised land
(Hold my hand) Maybe we can change the world, but
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can, yeah

Oh
Let me run, won't you let me run... 

(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be
(Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because
I... oh no-no, no no no

(Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand
(Hold my hand) I'll take you to the promised land
(Hold my hand) Maybe we can change the world, but
I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can

Oh
The best that I can
