I only meant to love you
Didn't you know it babe
Didn't you know it
Why couldn't you be content
With the love i gave oh yeah
I gave you my heart
But you wanted my mind, oh yeah
Your love scared me to death, girl
Oh it's the chokin' kind
That's all it is

You can kill a man
With a bottle of poison or a knife
I know you can
It'll hurt him more to take his pride
And ruin his life
Oh it's a shame girl
Whatever you want girl
I surely hope you find, oh yeah
I tell you that hat don't fit my head
Oh, it's the chokin' kind

It makes me wanna
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Oh yeah, oh listen to me

When you fall in love again girl
Take a tip from me oh yeah
If you don't like a peach, walk on by the tree
That's what you gonna do, honey
Find what you want girl
Keep it, treat it, sweet and kind, oh yeah
Oh let it breathe
Oh, don't make it the chokin' kind

Oh no, don't break your heart baby
Oh no, I know you love me really i do, honey
I tell you your love scares me to death girl
It's the chokin' kind
That's all it is
I got to say it again
It's that old chokin' kind
