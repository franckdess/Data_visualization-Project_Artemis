Yeah
Get off
Pretty ladies are at our discretion
So we can get off
We keep under the sheets with two lovelies
So we can get off
Sly look that we keep the promise, ladies
And make me get off
Take it from girls with our imagination
So we can get off
Call me up at your place, I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement, that's what makes a lady
Find out what she wants in a man
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get off
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Lookin' through that dress that drive me crazy and makes me get off
Sensuality excites my mind, it makes get off
If I were you I'd get a good perspective on how to get off
Love me wild and love me crazy, so we can get off
Call me up at your place, I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement, that's what makes a lady
Find out what she wants in a man
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get off
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off
So get off to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off to get off, to get off, get off
So get off, get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off to get off, get off, get off
To get off, to get off, to get off, to get, get off
Get off, get off, get off, to get off
Get off to get off, get off, get, get off
Get off, get off, so get off, just get off
Get off, get off, get off
