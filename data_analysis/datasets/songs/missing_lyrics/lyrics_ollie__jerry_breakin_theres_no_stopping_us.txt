Do it
Hold on

Out in the street, you don't survive by being weak
This is our time, walls were made for us to climb
Don't you try to lock us out
'Cause we're breakin' down the doors
And all we're prepared to fight
Yeah, yeah

There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

Long overdue
No playin' game or being used
Something to prove
It's more than just a dream come true

We have waited far too long
For this moment to arrive
Hey, hey

There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better than me and you)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter

Do it
Do it
Do it
Breakdance
Do it
Can you breakdance?

We have waited for too long
For this moment to arrive
Hey, hey

There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better (No one does it better)
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
Really doesn't matter
There's no stoppin' us (No stoppin')
No one does it better
