I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, and I ain't looking back
On the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
Lived a million miles of memories on that road
Every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
Yeah

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Oh, who says you can't go home?
