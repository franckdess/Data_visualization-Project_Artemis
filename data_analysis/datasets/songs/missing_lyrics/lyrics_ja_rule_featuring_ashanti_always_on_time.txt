Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

Here at W-I-Z, we play nothing but the hits, nothing but the hits
Nothing but the motherfucking hits
