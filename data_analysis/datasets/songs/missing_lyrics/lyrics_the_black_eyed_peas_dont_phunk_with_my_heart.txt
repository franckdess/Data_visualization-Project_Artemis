Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)

In love, baby (ove, love)

Girl, you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
You can't stop me once I start it
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming, baby, don't doubt it
(Don't make me wait) So let's be about it

No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come with lustin', lustin'
'Cause I'll bring you that comfort
I ain’t only here 'cause I want your
Body, I want your mind too
Interestin' what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl, yee-haw!
Come on

Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)

Girl, you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you play Whitney (all long)
If you smoke I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool

No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

When you got passionate love hurr?
You always claimin' I'm a cheatah

For another señorita

You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe-a
