I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of getting away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!
No problems

Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues what blues hey I forgot them
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!

Babe let's get packed tank tops and flip flops if you got them
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
No problems
