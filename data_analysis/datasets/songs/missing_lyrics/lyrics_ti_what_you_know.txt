Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?

Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at?
Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that?

See me in your city, sittin' pretty know I'm shinin dog
Ridin' with a couple Latin broads and a China doll
And you know how we ball, riding in shiny cars
Walk in designer malls, buy everything we saw
You know about me dog, don't talk about me dog
And if you doubt me dog, you better out me dog
I'm throwed off slightly bro, don't wanna fight me bro
I'm fast as lightning bro, you better use your Nikes bro
Know you don't like me cause your bitch most likely does
She see me on them dubs in front of every club
I be on dro, I'm buzzed, gave every ho a hug
Niggas don't show me mugs cause you don't know me cuz

Candy on the six four, leather guts and fish bowl
Fifty on my pinky ring just to make my fist glow
Your bitches get low because I get dough
So what I'm rich ho? I'll still pull a kick do'
What you talking shit for, you gotta run and get four
Got you yelling and I thought you pull out a gun hit four
But you's a scary dude believed by very few
Just keep it very cool or we will bury you
See all that attitude's unnecessary dude
You never carry tools, not even square, he cube
You got these people fooled, who see me on the tube
Whatever try the crew, they'll see you on the news

Fresh off the jet to the block, burning rubber with the top popped
My partners busting shots, I tell em "stop, it make the block hot"
Yo label got got cuz you are not hot
I got the top spot and it will not stop
A video or not that will bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
Although we not y'all, if it may pop off
I'll answer the question "Will I get your block knocked off?"
This what it is bro, look, I will kill bro
I'm in your hood if you a gangsta what you hid for
Somebody better get bro before he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for
