Nah nah nah, see, you got to understand
Steppin' is not just a dance, it's a, it's a culture
It's the, it's the way we live
It's what we eat, think, and breathe, you understand me?
See, you know, you out there on the dance floor and you with your partner
And y'all holdin' hands and y'all swingin' and swayin'
And you turnin' 'em and twistin' 'em and dippin' 'em
It's just such an exciting feelin' you get
You know what I mean?

Yeah, it's the Pied Piper of R&B, y'all (Whoa, oh, oh)
Follow me (Yeah)
Chicago n' them (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Don Juan and them (Yeah)
This is for y'all, the remix

Said I know that it's somebody's birthday tonight somewhere
And I know somebody's gonna celebrate tonight somewhere
I know...

(One things for sure)
I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes
(Then I'ma hit the door)
And go out and step the whole night through

Step in the name of love (I'm gonna)
Step in the name of love (then I'm gonna)
Clap in the name of love (oh yeah)
Clap in the name of love
(I'm gonna step)
Step in the name of love (woo)
Step in the name of love (in the name of love)
Groove in the name of love
Groove in the name of love

See I know, there's somebody's breaking out the champagne somewhere
And you can be sure (you can be sure)
Somebody's gonna make love
Night until the day (oh one thing)

(One thing's for sure)
I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes
(Then I'm gonna hit the floor)
And go out and step the whole night through

Step in the name of love (yeah)
Step in the name of love (whoa)
Clap in the name of love (yeah)
Clap in the name of love (said I'm gonna step)
Step in the name of love (woo)
Step in the name of love (in the name of love)
Groove in the name of love
Groove in the name of love

Oh, I'll wait til somebody else gets up
Then I, I wanna be the first one to hit the floor (Ooh, so, so...)
So tell the DJ to turn it up (turn it up)
'Cause it feels so good dancing to this remix
Makes me wanna step, 'cause it's a cut!

Snap in the name of love (oh baby)
Snap in the name of love (I'm...gonna)
Clap in the name of love (yeah)
Clap in the name of love (step in the name...)
Step in the name of love (...of love)

In the name of love
