Somethin' special, unforgettable
50 Cent, Cent, Justin, 'tin
Timbaland, 'land, goddamn, damn
She, she, she want it, I want to give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down
I'm ballin', throwing money around

She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the flo'
Her money money, she make it make it
Look at the way she shake it shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double jointed from the way she split it
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spot
And dance in your lap till you ready to pop

She always ready, when you want it she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
(Let me talk to you)

Baby, you're so new age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?
You got me saying, "Ayo!" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, so I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, so I gotta give it to her

Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you, girl

Got a thang for that thang she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
(Let me talk to you)

Baby, you're so new age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?
You got me saying, "Ayo!" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, so I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, so I gotta give it to her

Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you girl
