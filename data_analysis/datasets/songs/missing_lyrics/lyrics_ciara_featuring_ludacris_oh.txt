This is where they stay crunk, throw it up
Dubs on the Cadillac
White tees, Nike's, gangsta's don't know how to act
Adamsville, Bankhead, College Park, Carver Homes
Hummers floatin' on chrome
Chokin' on that home-grown
They got that Southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Thinkin' I was easy, I can see it
That's when I say no, what fo'?
Shawty can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like...

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it ghetto, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it, ladies back it up
Gettin' crunk up in tha club we gets low, oh

Buddy take a new whip, paint strip, in a bowlin' ball
Still smoke, hundred spoke, wood-grain on the wall
Light-skinned thick chicks, fellas call 'em redbones
Close cuts, braids, long, gangsta's love 'em all
They got that southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Wishin' I was easy, I can see it
That's when I say no, what fo'?
Shawty can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like...

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to the flo'
Handle it ladies, back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club, we gets low, oh

Southern-style, get wild, old skools comin' down in a different color whip (Whip, whip)
Picture perfect, you might wanna take a flick, flick, flick, flick, flick
Call up Jazze, tell him pop up the bottles
'Cause we got another hit (Hit, hit)
Wanna go platinum? I'm who you should get, get, get, get, get
Ludacris on the track, get back trick, switch on the 'Lac, Im flexin' still
Same price every time, hot song, jumped on 'cause Ciara got sex appeal
And I keep the meanest, cleanest, baddest, spinnin' on stainless wheels
Could care less about your genus, I bump ya status, I keep the stainless steel
Trunk-rattlin' what's happenin', huh?
I don't even think I needa speed
Bass-travelin', face-crackilin' huh?
Turn it up and make the speakers bleed
Dirty south, we ballin' dawg
And neva think about fallin dawg
Ghetto harmonizing, surprising, runnin back cuz the song is called

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to the flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club we gets low, oh
Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in the club, we gets low, oh
Oh (Oh), all my ladies to the flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin' crunk up in the club we gets low, oh
