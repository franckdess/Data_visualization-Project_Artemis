Whoo!

Pretty woman walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman, I don't believe you, it must be true
No one could look as good as you
Mercy

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman, oh, you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?
(growl)

Pretty woman, stop a while
Pretty woman, talk a while
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me
'Cause I need you, need you tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away-ay, okay
If that's the way it must be, okay
I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait
What do I see?
She's walking back to me
Whoa-whoa, pretty woman
