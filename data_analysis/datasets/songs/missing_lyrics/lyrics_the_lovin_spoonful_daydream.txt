What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy
And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face in somebody's new mowed lawn
I've been havin' a sweet dream
I've been dreamin' since I woke up today
It's starring me in my sweet dream
Cause she's the one that makes me feel this way
And even if time is passin' me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad
And you can be sure that if you're feelin right
A day dream will last a long time into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be dreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreamin' boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' about my bundle of joy
