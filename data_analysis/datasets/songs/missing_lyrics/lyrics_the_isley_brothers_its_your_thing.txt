It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do now
I can't tell you who to sock it to
Alright
Aw, have mercy

Ah, it's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to, hit me man
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love girl, to whoever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now

It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
I can't tell you who to sock it to
It's your thing (it's your thing), do what you wanna do
Don't let me tell you who to sock it to

Let me hear ya say, "It's my thing (it's my thing)
I do what I want to do."
I can't tell you
