Dig if you will the picture, of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling, can you picture this ?
Dream if you can a courtyard, an ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold ?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother, she's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other ?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach, feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride
