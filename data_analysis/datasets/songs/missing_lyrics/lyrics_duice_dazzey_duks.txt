Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies
Chorus: Creo-D
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
Everybody
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
I want you to
Look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on

Say, look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
They really got it goin' on
Lookin' all nice and sweet
Showin' tan
And them butt cheeks
I do like it a lot
When they be showin' some of what you got
Yo, girls that be lookin' real cute
The way y'all kickin' them Daisy Dukes

Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies
Repeat Chorus

"YEAH, just hit me" --] Afrika Bambattaa

Hey, you, in the black boots
Knee, highs, with the Daisy Dukes
Lookin' real fly while in cahoots
In the park, where I can do you
I'm L.A. Sno, here to relate to you
How I started the trend of them Daisy Dukes
Ever since, the summer of the â€™90s
Girls lookin' good, with their future behind, see
Many terms are used to express
We're talkin' 'bout the booty, not the breast
Baby got back, the junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo
Please, some fries with that shake
See, many terms are used to relate
I love the girls with the big ol' booties
Where I'm from, they call 'em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks, hangin' from the jeans
Even city girls kick the country things
So if you get it, got it good, just dip the dug out
Them damn Daisy Dukes are turnin' 'er out
Say

Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies
Repeat Chorus

"YEAH, just hit me"

Say, look at them girls with the Daisy Dukes on
They really got it goin' on
Yeah, they be kickin' it sweet
With them long ol' boots on feet
And check out the way they step
Make your brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
If they're tan, drive off red
It don't mean what kind of legs you like
Still be kickin' those legs in lily white
So it won't make one difference on you
As long as you're kickin' them Daisy Dukes

Come on, baby
Kick them Daisies
Repeat Chorus

"YEAH, just hit me"
"Hold it now"
"Wait a minute"

Yo
Bring that funky track back
Bring that funky track back
Bring that funky track back
Bring that funky track back
Oh, bring it, baby
