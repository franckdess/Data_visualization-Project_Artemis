Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, oh, yeah

I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, babe, oh yeah, yeah
I want a lover who knows me, yeah
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights 'till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?

Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
With you, baby

I don't want another pretender, no
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind, no no
No, no, no, no, no, baby
I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Everyday of my life, always
So come and take me away

Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you


Baby, come and take me away
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down (Take me down)
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately (I need you, baby)
Won't you please (Won't you please) come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down (Take me down)
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately (Come on, baby)
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
