Which way you goin' Billy?
Can I go too?
Which way you goin' Billy?
Can I go with you?
I really love you, Billy
And all this time
I thought you loved me, Billy
And you were mine
I'm gonna miss you, Billy
And though I'm trying
I'm hurting so bad, Billy
I can't help crying
You are my whole, babe
My heart and my soul, babe
I'd have nothing to show, babe
If you should go away
You are my whole, babe
My heart and my soul, babe
I'd have nothing to show, babe
If you should go
Which way you going, Billy?
Or need I ask?
Cause you don't want me, Billy
You're free at last
I won't forget you, Billy
For all my life
I'll always love you, Billy
I'll stay your wife
You are my whole, babe
My heart and my soul, babe
I'd have nothing to show, babe
If you should go away
You are my whole, babe
My heart and my soul, babe
I'd have nothing to show, babe
If you should go
You are my whole, babe
My heart and my soul, babe
I'd have nothing to show, babe
If you should go
I won't forget you, Billy...
