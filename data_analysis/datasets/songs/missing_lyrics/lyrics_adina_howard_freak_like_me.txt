Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has got to deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cause it's all about the dog in me, mmm, mmm

I want a freak in the mornin'
A freak in the evenin', just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man, 'cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

'Cause I will be a freak until the day until the dawn
And we can boom boom all through the night 'til the early morn'
Come on and I will take you around the hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can boom boom
Any time of day, it's all good for me

Boy, you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up now, there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do, mmhmm
I'm packin' all the flavor you need
I got you shook up on your knees
'Cause it's all about the dog in me

I want a freak in the mornin'
A freak in the evenin', just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man, 'cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

'Cause I will be a freak until the day until the dawn (Oh yeah)
And we can boom boom all through the night 'til the early morn
Come on and I will take you around the hood on a gangsta lean (Take you around the hood, babe)
'Cause we can boom boom
Any time of day, it's all good for me (It's all good)
'Cause I will be a freak until the day until the dawn
And we can boom boom all through the night 'til the early morn (You bring out the freak in me)
Come on and I will take you around the hood on a gangsta lean (Take you around the hood, babe)
'Cause we can boom boom
Any time of day, it's all good for me (It's all good for me)

One to the two, to the two, to the three
Adina, do you want to get freaky with me?
