Hey kids, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh my soul
Hey kids, boogie too, did ya?
Hey shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes
Hey kids, rock and roll, rock on
And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?
Still looking for that blue jean
Baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen
