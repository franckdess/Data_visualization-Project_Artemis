{Intro}
I see that worried look upon your face
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away
Now, just like you, I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
You need some sympathy? well, so do I
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She used to love me, that I know, wow wow
And it don't seem so long ago, wow wow
That we were walking
That we were talking
The way that lovers dooooo....
{Bridge}

You've got your troubles, I've got mine
{Simultanousely}
And it must seem to you, my friend
That I ain't got no pity for you
Well, that ain't true
