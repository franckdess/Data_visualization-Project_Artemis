I was in love with you
I gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
You said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done to make you be so rough

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart?
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel?
I don't understand why you've been so wrong

I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise
So we could get along
I gave my love to you
Despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart
It's telling you that something is strange
Ooh girl, you don't have to deny it
All you got to do is just try it
You'll find our love is stronger if you're willing to change

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your ways
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
