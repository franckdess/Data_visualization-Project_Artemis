Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Black and orange stray cat sittin' on a fence
Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent
I'm flat broke but I don't care
I strut right by with my tail in the air
Stray cat strut I'm a ladies' cat
I'm a feline Casanova (Hey, man, that's that)
Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man
Get my dinner from a garbage can
(Meow) Yeah, don't cross my path!

I don't bother chasing mice around (Oh no!)
I slink down the alley lookin' for a fight
Howlin' to the moonlight on a hot summer night
Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry
"Wild stray cat, you're a real gone guy"
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style
