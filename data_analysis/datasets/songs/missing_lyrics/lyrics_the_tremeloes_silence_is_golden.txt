Oh don't it hurt deep inside
To see someone do something to her
Oh don't it pain to see someone cry
Especially if that someone is her
Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see
Talking is cheap, people follow like sheep
Even though there is nowhere to go
How could she tell he deceived her so well
Pity, she'll be the last one to know
Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see
Doo-wee-doo-wah-wah
Doo-wee-doo-wah-wah
How many times will she fall for his lines
Should I tell her or should I be cool
And if I tried, I know she'd say I lied
Mind your business don't hurt her you fool
Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see
But my eyes still see
But my eyes still see
