Once there was a boy and girl
Boy said "I love you so"
Girl said "I'll never leave you"
They grew older and left each other
'Cause that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
Then there's a time
Seems like you'll never find
Someone willing to love you
Keep on lookin', you'll soon discover
A mighty love
Will sometimes make you weep and moan
A mighty love
You'll sit all day by the telephone
'Cause you're all alone
You need a mighty love
Hey
Some say that you're sure to find
True love and peace of mind
At the end of a rainbow
There's no sign in the sky to follow
'Cause that's the way love goes
Baby, that's the way love goes
And so there's a rhyme
That says life will soon be fine
Love is just what you make it
Keep on lovin', you'll soon discover
A mighty love
Will sometimes make a weak man strong
A mighty love
Will sometimes make a rich man weep
And knock him off his feet
To have a mighty love
Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty
Mighty, mighty love jones
Comin' down on me baby yeah
Hey, hey
I can feel the world getting' brighter
Brighter with your lovin'
You see baby
With a mighty love you can
Sometimes turn the world around
With a mighty love you can, you can
Turn the world around sometimes
Yes you can, uh
Hey baby
Makes music have a ha-ha-happy sound
Makes you move, makes you groove
You got the feelin' head is reelin'
Come on
Ha ha
I gon' gon' gon' gon' get your lovin'
