Honey why you callin’ me so late?
It’s kinda hard to talk right now
Honey why you cryin’ is every-thing okay
I gotta whisper cause I can’t be too loud

Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It‘s funny that you’re callin’ me tonight
And yes I’ve dreamt of you too
Does he know you’re talkin’ to me
Will it start a fight?
No I don’t think she has a clue

Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

Well, my girl’s in
The next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It’s really good to hear your voice
Sayin’ my name it sounds so sweet
Comin’ from the lips of an angel
Hearin’ those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
(And I never wanna say goodbye)
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
Honey why you callin’ me so late?
