How can people be so heartless?
How can people be so cruel?
Easy to be hard
Easy to be cold
How can people have no feelings?
How can they ignore their friends?
Easy to be proud
Easy to say No
Especially people who care about strangers
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the "being crowd"?
How about a needed friend? I need a friend
How can people be so heartless?
You know I'm hung up on you
Easy to be proud
Easy to say No
Especially people who care about strangers
Who care about evil and social injustice
Do you only care about the "being crowd"?
How about a needed friend? We all need a friend
How can people be so heartless?
How can people be so cruel?
Easy to be proud
Easy to say no
Easy to be cold
Easy to say no
Come on, easy to give in
Easy to say No
Easy to be cold
Easy to say No
Oh, it's too easy to say No
