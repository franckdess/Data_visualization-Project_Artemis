It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears
After all these years
No sunshine
No moonlight
No stardust
No sign of romance
We don't stand a chance
I've always dreamed
I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be
Like every other man
I've loved, I've loved
Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear
If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill
Get the check pay the bill
You can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eye
And simply shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on
I can't go on
No more no
Enough is enough
I want him out
I want him out
That door now
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough
If you've reached the end
Don't pretend that is right
When it's over
(It's over)
If the feeling is gone
Don't think twice
Just move on
Get it over
(Over, over)
Tell him to just get out
Say it clearly
Spell it out
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on
I can't go on
No more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out
I want him out
That door now
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough
I've always dreamed
To find the perfect lover
But he turns out to be
Like every other man
I've loved
(I had no choice from the start)
I've loved
(I've gotta listen to my heart)
I've loved
(Tearing us apart)
I've loved
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on
I can't go on
No more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out
I want him out
That door now
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough
No more tears
(No more tears)
No more tears
(No more tears)
No more tears
(No more tears)
No more tears
(No more tears)
Enough is enough
Is enough is enough
Is enough is enough
I've had it
You've had it
He's had it
We've had is
I always dreamed
I find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be
Like every other man
I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on
I can't go on
No more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out
I want him out
That door now
Goodbye mister
Goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar
It's raining
It's pouring
There's nothing left
For us here
And we won't waist
Another tear
No more tears
Is enough is enough
Is enough is enough
Is enough is enough
Is enough is enough!
