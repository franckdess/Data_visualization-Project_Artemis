Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Let me still exist, in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade
Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, someway
Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up! Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I will

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
The rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
Ooh, hoo-hoo, ooh
