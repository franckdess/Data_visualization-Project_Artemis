Jump down the shelters to get away
The boys are cockin' up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is, can we all come?
Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying
Don't think we move too slow
It's no use after crying
Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
After the laughter has died away
And all the boys have had their fun
No surface noise now, not much to say
They got the bad guys on the run
Don't try to say you're sorry
Don't say he drew his gun
They've gone and grabbed old Ronnie
He's not the only one
Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
Tell us, commander, what do you think?
'Cos we know that you love all that power
Is it on then, are we on the brink?
We wish you'd all throw in the towel
We'll not fade out too soon
Not in this finest hour
Whistle your favourite tune
We'll send a card and flower
Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake, oh
It's a mistake (it's a mistake)
It's a mistake (it's a mistake)
It's a mistake (it's a mistake)
It's a mistake (it's a mistake)
It's a mistake (it's a mistake)
It's a mistake (it's a mistake)
It's a mistake, it's a mistake
(It's a mistake)
