Some dreams are in the night time
And some seem like yesterday
But leaves turn brown and fade
Ships sail away
You long to say a thousand words
But seasons change
It feels like it's forever
No reason for emptiness
The time just runs away
No more day by day
You dream again
It seems in vain
When seasons change
(I want you)
I want to feel you by my side
(I need you)
Don't you know I need you, baby?

Seasons change
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
Seasons change
People change
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today

Forever seems so far away
There's time for love and for play
You dream about today
Feeling slips away
The winds that blow
They go away
And seasons change
(I want you)
Don't hide your feelings from inside
(I need you)
I've got to have your love now, baby

Seasons change
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
Seasons change
People change

(I want you)
I want to feel you by my side
(I need you)
I've got to have your love now, baby

Seasons change
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
Seasons change
People change
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today
Just to have you here today
Seasons change
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
Seasons change
(Seasons change)
People change
(People change)
Seasons change
(Seasons change)
Feelings change
(Feelings change)
Change the season
Seasons change
People change
Seasons change
Feelings change
