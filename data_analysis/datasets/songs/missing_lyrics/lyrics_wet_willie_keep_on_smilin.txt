Well, you say you've got the blues
You've got holes in both your shoes, yeah
You're feeling alone and confused
You got to keep on smilin', just keep on smilin'
Yeah, you're 'bout to go insane
'Cause your woman's playin' games
And she says that you're to blame
Just keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin' through the rain
Laughin' at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes
Till the sun comes out again
Singin' in a honkey tonk cafe
But nobody's hearin' what you play
They're too busy drinkin' anyway
You gotta keep on smilin'
Say you found a piece of land
You're gonna change from city boy
To country man, yeah
Try to build your life with your hands
And just keep on smilin', keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin' through the rain
Laughin' at the pain
Just flowin' with the changes
Till the sun comes out again
You're just hangin' out at a local bar
And you're wonderin', who the hell you are?
Are you a farmer? Are you a star?
Smile on through the rain
Laugh through all the pain
Flow on with the changes
Till the sun shines out again
Keep on smilin', smilin', laughin', laughin'
Flowin', flowin', flowin', flowin'
