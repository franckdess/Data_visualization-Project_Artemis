Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are
What you are, baby
Look at you, getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are
What you are, baby

Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

Daddy-O, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way, I'm never gonna fall for you
Never you, baby

Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't 'cause we don't, you...

Womanizer
Woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh
You're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are
You-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You got me going, you're oh-so-charming
But I can't do it, you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
You say I'm crazy, I got you crazy
You're nothing but a womanizer

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
