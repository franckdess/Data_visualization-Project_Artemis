Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better loking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can
I used to have a girlfriend
But she just couldn't compete
With all of these love starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet
Well I prob'ly could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me
Who cares, I never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can
I guess you could say I'm a loner
A cowboy outlaw tough and proud
I could have lots of friends if I want to
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
Hell, I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way that I
Fill out my skin tight blue jeans
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better looking each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
But I'm doing the best that I can
We're doing the best that we can
