You're a little late, so step right this way and we'll get started
What? Say it now? Oh. say it now, say it now. Ahem!
Me and the Ohio Players are gonna tell you about a worm
He's the funkiest worm in the world Alright. Sing it, Clarence
Theres' a worm in the ground, yes there is
Thats right
He's six feet long
Six feet long
He only comes around
 when he wants to get down
But when he comes out of his hole
He sounds something like this

Oh that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Alright. Sing it again, Clarence
And through all the land, yeah
Yeah
He plays in a band
Plays in a band
Plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add
Yeah, when he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to get up and dance

Ah, get it baby
Don't, don't, don't
Don't fight the feeling. Don't fight it
Hey, don't stop now honey, get down
I'm his manager, heh heh
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all, cause he can't spend it
There he goes
Goin' back in his hole, just the same way he came out
Do we get paid for this?
I just wanted to make sure. We do? OK
