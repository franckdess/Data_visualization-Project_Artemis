I don't care if you never come home
I don't mind if you just keep on
Rowing away on a distant sea
Because I don't love you and you don't love me
You cause a commotion when you come to town
You give them a smile and they melt
Having lovers and friends is all good and fine
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

I don't care what you do at night
Oh, and I don't care how you get your delights
I will leave you alone, I will just let it be
I don't love you and you don't love me

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end?
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

I tried to love you for years upon years
You refuse to take me for real
It's time you saw what I want you to see
And I would still love you, if you'd just love me

I got a problem. Can you relate?
I got a woman calling love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end?
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la
