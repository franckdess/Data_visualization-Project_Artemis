Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of
Groovin', down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
We can be anyone we want to be
And all those happy people we could meet just
Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it comin' closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly
Groovin', on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha
