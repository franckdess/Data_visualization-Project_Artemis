Cause he don't love your eyes (No)
And he don't love your smile (No)
Girl, you know that ain't fair (C'mon)

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side? (No, no)
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know ;cause things ain't clear
And baby, when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl, you should be my girlfriend

Or does he break your stride? (C'mon)
Did you know that love could be a shield? Yeah

Need a fiancé, cute as Beyoncé
Ghetto like Da Brat, ready to scrap when I say
The talents of Alicia, my fault, Ms. Keys
I take the hips off Trina, and lips off Eve
I put ya so high on a pedestal, it might make ya nose bleed
So much ice around ya ankles, and watch ya toes freeze
Whats wrong, ma? Ya man ain't bringing ya joy?
Don't trip, flip ya scrip to a country boy
Now c'mon

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you, my world would end, yeah
I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend, oh

Why don't you be my girlfriend? (Yeah)
I'll treat you good
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
(I know you hear your friends when they say you should)
'Cause if you were my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
