Yeah, yeah

When I walk on by, girls be looking like "Damn he fly"
I pimp to the beat, walking down the street in my new LaFreak
Yeah, this is how I roll, animal print, pants outta control
It's Redfoo with the big afro
And like Bruce Leroy, I got the glow, yeah

Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body (I-I-I work out)
Girl look at that body

Girl look at that body (I-I-I work out)

When I walk in the spot (Yeah), this is what I see (Okay)
Everybody stops and is staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
Show it, show it, show it
I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

Yeah
When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight em' all
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks (What)
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service, watch
