This goes out to all the women in the world, especially her
You know it don't even matter your age; it don't even matter your color
Yo, fellas, I ain't forgettin' 'bout y'all
This is for everybody who like to dance
Just listen to what I'm sayin' and do it, and take a chance

I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

Just get on the floor like I said befo'
Y'all remember that "Down Low"!
Just put a little dip wit' it
Now roll those hips wit' it
Pop it, push it, rock it, roll it
Can't control it? I'll come hold it
It's all in fun so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance, y'all
I know you like this so, don't try to fight it
Turn around, baby, let me see you from the back
Yeah, I like it like that
Get up now, roll those hips
Drop down, double-up on those dips
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

Back again with the second verse
It's all clean, so I'm not gonna curse
Droppin' bass like a bad habit
Love all women, cause I gotta have it
Comin' at y'all in stereo
I'm ridin' that thing like a rodeo
Hang on, baby, cause the ride is rough, and ...
 {OOH!}
I got my girls in the front
Now a lady just bumpin' that rump
Raise it up, let me see that brown
Slap it, girl, make it jiggle around
Round and round that rump goes
Where it stop, yo, no one knows, yeah
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind
Well alright, y'all! If you ain't dippin', you must
Be trippin'! If you ain't doin it Down Low, you gots
To go! To the people thats movin' slow to the
Dance floor! Yo DJ! Pump it up some MO-O-O-O .....

It's off to the show in a limo
Before the show, I gotta get that dough
Pay them girls what they're worth
Slip that money under that skirt
Take it off, baby, let me see
You might get a lil' mo' lucci
G-string havin' oh so much fun
Playin' inside, between them buns
Shortie got it on like Marvin
Teasin' me and you know I'm starvin'
Lick you up, then lick you down
I ain't finished; girl, turn around
Lick you up and down your back
Cause I'm that freak, I'm freaky like that!
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

I'm settin' it off to another level
You're diggin' Freak Nasty without a shovel
This is my world; I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut, so wassup
Yo, DJ, when the party's getting slow
Join this jam on and watch that flow
Get taken over like in '94
When I had the whole world gettin' Down Low
New Orleans born, ATL livin'
Freak Nasty's what I'm givin'
My juice is sweet like Georgia Peaches
Women suck it up like leeches
Uh-huh, if you're so good
You must admit you like this shhhhhhhhhh
Yeah, y'all know the song
So come on won't you sing it with me?
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
