On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Because you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you, I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts

Ohh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Ohh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, messy
I get restless, and it's senseless
And you never seem to care
When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, it's your mission
And you won't stop 'til I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Ohh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Ohh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know everything I'm about to say?
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away, yeah

On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading
Into your arms, so I can breathe

Ohh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Ohh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
Ohh, I love how you can tell
Ohh, I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
