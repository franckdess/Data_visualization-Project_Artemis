Yo mic check, mic check, yeah here you go
Nah, he over here
Yeah, I heard he got that hot new thing
It's called "Switch" (switch)
Let's get it going

(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it

(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Something sexy bout a
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now Switch!

(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Switch
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la

I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like 'Ooo he's a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody'
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on
Switch!

(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la
Switch
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it
Ooh la la la
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, heeeeeeeeeeeeey)

Oh you just gonna stand there huh?
What you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that Switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right here waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that Switch-a-roo
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, Switch
