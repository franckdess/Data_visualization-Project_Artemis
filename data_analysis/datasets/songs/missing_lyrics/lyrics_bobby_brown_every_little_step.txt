I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night
Now now now now, come down now
Oh yes! It's me again! The crazy one!

I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that girl

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Everybody wants to know what's going down
Not with the James, not the Jim, but the Bobby Brown
Now I'm chilling much harder as you all know
Cause Bobby Brown was good to good to good to go solo
Been on the microphone a long long time
I'm guaranteed to bust a stupid rhyme
Now I'm on the mic and I'm rocking real fresher
Everybody out there don't talk less about me
Cause I'm rocking it steady
And when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy
Cause I'm ready to really get paid
And if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed
My name is Brown, that's what they call me,
Yes, I drive a 560 SEC
And when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me
Driving down the block cause I'm blocking and locking
When the sucker M.C.'s trying to drop my spot
When I'm rocking on the microphone
People gotta gotta gotta gotta leave me alone
Cause I really don't care, really don't give a damn
My name is Bobby, and not Uncle Sam!
Shaba dootin ba
Shaba dootin bop shoo ba
Shaba dootin ba
Shaba dootin bop shoo ba
No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
We will always be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that girl!
Every little step I take, you will be there (yeah yeah)
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there (you'll be, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we will be together
