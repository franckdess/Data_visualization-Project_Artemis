Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy
First time that I saw you, girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you
With fellas hanging 'round you all the time
I want you for my sweet pet
But you keep playing hard to get
I'm going around in circles all the time
Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy
I finally got to talk to you
And I told you just exactly how I felt
Then I held you close to me
And kissed you and my heart began to melt
Girl, you've got control on me
'Cause I'm so dizzy I can't see
I need to call a doctor for some help
Dizzy
I'm so dizzy my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool it never ends
And it's you girl making it spin
You're making me dizzy
You're making me dizzy
I'm so dizzy
You're making me dizzy
