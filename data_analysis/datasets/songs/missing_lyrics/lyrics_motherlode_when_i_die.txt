When I die I hope to be
A better man then you thought I'd be
It's been hard to make you see
What kind of man I'm trying to be
All I ask for you to try
To understand what it means to me
It's not hard to understand why you
Get discouraged all the time
I keep trying not to worry but I
Can't help feeling lost in you
But I love you, want you
And I need you
Time goes by and you'll find
That we'll achieve a love sublime
When I die, I hope I'll be
The kind of man that you thought I'd be
It's not hard to understand why you
Get discouraged all the time
I keep trying not to worry but I
Can't help feeling lost in you
But I love you, want you
And I need you
Cause I love you
And I want you
Cause I gotta, gotta have you
Cause I, cause I need you
When I die, I hope I'll be
The kind of man that you thought I could be
Be (The kind of man that you thought I)
