Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea winds blowin'
I still see her dark eyes glowin'
She was twenty-one
When I left Galveston

Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

Galveston, oh Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch
Your sea birds flying in the sun

At Galveston
At Galveston
