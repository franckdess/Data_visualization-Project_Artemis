I will survive
Without you
Don't tell me that you wanna leave
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Walk out that door, see if I care
Go on and go, but...

Don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know
I won't let you know

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight (holding me tight)
And if you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright (I'll be alright)

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
I know I'll survive
I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you: "Don't go"

As he walks away, he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life, they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
He's gone

Don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Baby, don't turn around!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Just walk away (just walk away)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
Don't turn around!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Just walk away
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
