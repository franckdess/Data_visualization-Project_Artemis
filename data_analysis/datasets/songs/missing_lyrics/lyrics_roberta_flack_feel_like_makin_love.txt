Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh, baby

When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet and low
When you're touchin' me
And my feelings start to show


In a restaurant
Holdin' hands by candlelight
While I'm touchin' you
Wanting you with all my might

Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing
Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
