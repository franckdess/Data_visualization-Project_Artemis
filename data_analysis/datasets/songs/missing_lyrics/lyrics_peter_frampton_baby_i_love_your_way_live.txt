Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly, the day turns into night
Far away from the city

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, hey

Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day, hey

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, hey

Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, ooh
Wanna be with you night and day, ooh yeah


Well, don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, hey

Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, ooh
Wanna be with you night and day
Ooh, baby, I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, ooh
Wanna be with you night and day, yeah
