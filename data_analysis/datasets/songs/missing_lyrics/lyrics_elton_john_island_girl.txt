I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey, so sweet
Down where Lexington cross 47th street
Oh, she's a big girl, she's standin' six-foot-three
Turnin' tricks for the dudes in the big city

Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

Well, she's black as coal, but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well-worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
Oh, he one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake

Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world?
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
