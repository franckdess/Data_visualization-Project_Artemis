Ma Belle Amie
You were a child of the sun and the sky and the deep blue sea
Ma belle amie
Apres tout les beau jours, je te dit merci merci!
You were the answer to all my questions before we were through
I want to tell you, that I adore you and always do
That you amaze me by leaving me now to start anew
Ma belle amie, I'm in love with you

Let's all give my substitute a big cheer
Let the bells ring
Let the birds sing, for the man after him waits here
For the man after him waits here

Let the bells ring
Let the birds sing, let's all give my substitute a big cheer
