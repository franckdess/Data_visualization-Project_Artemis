Ho!
You come on like a dream, peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful
And you're mine. (mine, all mine)
You're all ribbons and curls
Ooh, what a girl
Eyes that sparkle and shine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine
(mine, all mine, mine, mine)

You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed, i could not stop

You walked out of my dreams, into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine

You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed, i could not stop

You walked out of my dreams, into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine

You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
All mine
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
