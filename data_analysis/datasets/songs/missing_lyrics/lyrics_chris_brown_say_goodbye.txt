Ah, look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know but it's, it's just, it's just
Some things I gotta get off my chest, aight
Yeah, woah, woah-woah
Listen

Baby, come here and sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know

How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand what I'm tryna say, we just can't go on
Pretending that we get along, girl, how you not gon' see it? (Oh, oh, yeah)

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby I
I just can't do it, I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby I
I just can't do it and sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do you hear me crying?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

There's never a right time to say goodbye (Oh yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me (You gonna start hating me, baby)
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you (No more)
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I (It's me, yeah)
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh (About you and me)
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Oh, no it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye (Right time)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
