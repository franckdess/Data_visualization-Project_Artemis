Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called "Love"
Let me tell ya 'bout the stars in the sky
And a girl and a guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like this
When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from A to Z
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called "Love" (Yeah!)
When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from A to Z
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called "Love"
Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
'Bout the birds
And the bees
