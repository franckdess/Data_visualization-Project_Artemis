I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh
Yes, I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
I got me spinnin', baby
You know that I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh
(You better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock)
Ooh, baby, ooh
It's no secret about it
'Cause with his loving touch
He sees to it that I get enough
Feel his touch all over
You know it means so much
It's like thunder, burstin' lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think you better knock, knock, knock on wood)
