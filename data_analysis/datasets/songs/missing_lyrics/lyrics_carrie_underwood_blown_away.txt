Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Daddy was mean ol' mister, mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister, she prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar, listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter, she called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
(Blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
(Blown away)

Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away
