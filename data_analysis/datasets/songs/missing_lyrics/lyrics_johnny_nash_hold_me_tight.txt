I don't want to hear it
No more fussin' and fightin', baby
Hold me tight...
Let's let bygones be bygones
Let's think about tomorrow, girl
Our future's bright

Well, I know I was wrong
But, I was just a fool
Too blind to see
You were the only girl for me
Ah, but now I see the light
And everything's gonna be all right
Baby, hold me tight

Well, I know I was wrong
But, I was just a fool
Too blind to see
You were the only girl for me
Ah, but now I see the light
And everything's gonna be all right
Baby, hold me tight
Girl, you know I love
Ooh, you know I need you
I don't mean maybe
You will always be my baby
