I was talking with a friend of mine
Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so, and
Turned around and let him go
Then he said, "You better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size"

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby?
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you, baby
Don't do me like that

Listen, honey, can you see?
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in the public eye
Giving someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I need you, baby?
Don't do me like that

'Cause somewhere deep down inside
Someone is saying
"Love doesn't last that long"
I got this feeling inside
Night and day
And now I can't take it no more

Listen, honey, can you see?
Baby, you would bury me
If you were in the public eye
Giving someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you, baby?
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
I just might need you, honey
Don't do me like that
Wait!
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, oh, oh!
