Uh huh huh
Ohhh yeah
Work, work

Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe
But now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

Somebody tell me, Oh
(Won't you tell me)
Why I work so hard for you?
(To give you money, all to give you money)

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give, and take
Well you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Than how can it be good enough for two?
I can't work any harder than I do

Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you

Won't you tell me
Give you money, all to give you money
Oh ohh, Oh Yea
Tell me, tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time

My situation, never changes
Walking in , and out of that door
Like a stranger, but the wages
I give you all, you say you want more
And all I can see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time
Just a matter of...

Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you
Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you
Somebody tell me, want you to tell me
Why, i do the things i do
