Ay, what's happenin homey?
This yo' lil' boy Plies, man (shaw-tay)
Ay Pain, I want you tell 'em bout your shawty homie
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaaaaah)
And I'mma tell em bout mine, dawg

Now, even though I'm not yo man, you not my girl
I'mma call you my - shaaaaaaw-ty...
Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad, I beat his ass
For my - shaaaaaaaw-ty...
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't sup'POSED to do
Cause you my - shaaaaaaw-ty... (oh-oh)
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtoooone
Shaaaaaaw-ty - sang it to me girl!

Soon as I seen her, shieet, told her I'd pay for it
Lil' mama the baddest thing 'round here, she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her, "This s'posed to be yours" (ha ha!)
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga n' she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even kno' how to tho'it back
Now she a animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, "I'on't usually do this, I'on't fuck on the first night
Cause after I beat ya baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life!"
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil' bust-it baby, cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whatever I wanna get off, she know how to get me right

Now, even though I'm not yo man, you not my girl
I'mma call you my - shaaaaaaw-ty...
Cause I cain't stand to see you treated bad, I beat his ass
For my - shaaaaaaaw-ty...
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't sup'POSED to do
Cause you my - shaaaaaaw-ty... (oh-oh)
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtoooone
Shaaaaaaw-ty - sang it to me girl!

Oh-oh (whooooooooa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Shawwwwww-DEEEE-EEEE, yeah...
Oh-oh (whooooooooa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
(Shaaaaaaw-ty, yeah) SHAW-DEE, whoa, w-w-wh-oa, OH!

I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her
Know why dey wanna beat badly, look at all dat ass on her!
Look how dat pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bowlegged and bend the co'ner
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on 'em!
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga, do'nuh?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin 'er off, cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat her hunda
Babe snatchin, not now, I'm tellin ya, I promise!
I exposed her to real and now she hate lame
'member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thang
Ever since I ran up in shawty, she ain't been the same

Now, even though I'm not yo man, you not my girl
I'mma call you my - shaaaaaaw-ty...
Cause I cain't stand to see you treated bad, I beat his ass
For my - shaaaaaaaw-ty...
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't sup'POSED to do
Cause you my - shaaaaaaw-ty... (oh-oh)
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtoooone
Shaaaaaaw-ty - sang it to me girl!

Oh-oh (whooooooooa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Shawwwwww-DEEEE-EEEE, yeah...
Oh-oh (whooooooooa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (WH-OA-wh-oa, wh-oa), oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (whooooooooa)
(Shaaaaaaw-ty, yeah) SHAW-DEE, whoa, w-w-wh-oa, OH!
