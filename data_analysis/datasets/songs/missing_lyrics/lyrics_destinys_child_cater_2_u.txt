Baby, I see you working hard
I wanna let you know I'm proud
Let you know that I admire what you do
Don't know if I need to reassure you
My life would be purposeless without you
If I want it (you got it)
When I ask you (you provide it)
You inspire me to be better
You challenge me for the better
Baby, sit back and let me pour out my love letter
Let me help you
Take off your shoes
Untie your shoe strings
Take off your cuff links
What you wanna eat, boo?
Let me feed you
Let me run your bathwater
Whatever your desire, I'll supply ya
Sing you a song
Turn the game on
I'll brush your hair
Help you put your durag on
Want a foot-rub?
You want a manicure?
Baby, I'm yours, I wanna cater to you, boy

Let me cater to you
Cause, baby, this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I wanna cater to you

Baby, I'm happy you're home
Let me hold you in my arms
I just wanna take the stress away from you
Making sure that I'm doing my part
Boy, is there something you need me to do?
If you want it (I got it)
Say the word (and I'll try it)
I know whatever, I'm not fulfilling
Another woman is willing
I'm gonna fulfill your mind, body and spirit
I promise ya
I'll keep myself up
Remain the same chick
You fell in love with
I'll keep it tight, I'll keep my figure right
I'll keep my hair fixed, keep rockin' the hottest outfits
When you come home late, tap me on my shoulder, I'll roll over
Baby, I heard you, I'm here to serve you
If it's love you need to give it is my joy
All I wanna do, is cater to you, boy

Let me cater to you
Cause, baby, this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I wanna cater to you

I wanna give you my breath, my strength, my will to you
That's the least I can do
Let me cater to you
Through the good, the bad
The ups and the downs
I'll still be here for you
Let me cater to you
Cause you're beautiful
I love the way you are
Fulfill your every desire
Your wish is my command
I wanna cater to my man
Your heart (your heart)
So pure your love shines through
The darkness we'll get through
(So much) So much of me is you (is you)
I wanna cater to my man

Let me cater to you
Cause baby this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I wanna cater to you
