"Stay"
Stay (x3)
Stay baby
Stay, come on darling now
Stay, you know I want you back
Stay with me tonight
Come on won't you stay
Stay, oh
Stay
Stay with me
It seems I have the strangest dream
I'm dreaming that you are gonna leave me
I wake up and I find it's true
What will I do without you?
I don't know, I don't know
Just what it takes to get to you
I don't know, I don't know
Baby I'll be true if only you
Stay
Baby though I made you cry
Stay
Baby don't you say goodbye
Stay
Baby look me in my eye
Stay with me tonight
Come on baby
Baby though I made you cry
Stay
Baby don't you say goodbye
Stay
Won't you stay
They say that love will come and go
But your love's indispensible to me
I really wanna be with you
What are we gonna do boy
I don't know, I don't know
Just what it takes to get to you
I don't know, I don't know
Baby I'll be true if only you
Stay
Baby though I made you cry
Stay
Baby don't you say goodbye
Stay
Baby look me in my eye
Stay with me tonight
Even though I told you lies
Stay
Baby give me one more try
Stay
Stay with me
Come on baby
Won't you, won't you
Why don't you stay
Why don't you stay
Come on, come on, come on and stay
Come on, come on, come on and stay
Stay with me tonight
Oh, oh, oh
I want you to stay
Stay
Baby though I made you cry
Stay
Baby don't you say goodbye
Stay with me tonight
Come on baby
Made you cry
You don't have to say goodbye
Stay
