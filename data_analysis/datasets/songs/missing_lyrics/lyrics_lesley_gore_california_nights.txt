Along the sand, let's walk the shores together now
Yes, hand in hand, it's gonna be fair weather now
When the stars come out
Stop to count them in the sky

Love California nights when I'm walking with you
Hand in hand by the shore
Yes, I love California nights
At the beach where we'd swim with the tide rolling in

And there will be, beneath the midnight sky above
Just you and me, and we will whisper words of love
While the fire light softly flickers in the sky

Whoa, California nights, with the breeze blowing in
And time for love to begin
I would miss California nights if I went on my way
Thinking now that I'll stay

Oh, baby
I love you, baby
Mmm, baby

Love California nights, always plus is a kiss
Nothing sweeter than this
And we'll spend California nights
