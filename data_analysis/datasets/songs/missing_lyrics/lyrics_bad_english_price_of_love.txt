Girl, sometimes it seems to me
That I don't say the things I should
To you, I act like I'm no good
And you, wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you
It takes two hearts to share
Your eyes will always see through me
And bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you
You're everything I need
And through the good and bad times
You have always been there
We hold each other close
You tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it
Never dream of givin' up
That's the price of love
Love, sometimes it makes us cry
Forgive me when I get it wrong
Sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around
I'd find a way somehow
This time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past
We're more than lovers, more than friends
And through the good and bad times
You have always been there
We hold each other tight
You tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it
Never think of givin' up
That's the price of love
Your eyes will always see through me
And bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you
You're everything I need
And through the good and bad times
You have always been there
We hold each other close
You tell me it's alright
And sometimes I can't give enough
That's the price of love
That's the price of love, that's the price of love
That's the price of love...
