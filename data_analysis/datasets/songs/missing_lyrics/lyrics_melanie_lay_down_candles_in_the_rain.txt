Little sisters of the sun lit
Candles in the rain
Fed the world on oats and raisins
Candles in the rain
Lit the fire to the soul
Who never knew his friends
Meher Baba lives again
Candles in the rain
To be there is to remember
Lay it down again
Lay down
Lay down
Lay it down again
Men can live as brothers
Candles in the rain..
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
We were so close, there was no room
We bled inside each other's wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
So raise the candles high
Cause if you don't we could stay black against the night
Oh, raise them higher again
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
We were so close, there was no room
We bled inside each other's wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace
Some came to sing, some came to pray
Some came to keep the dark away
So raise the candles high
Cause if you don't we could stay black against the sky
Oh, raise them higher again
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
You got to lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
You got to lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Oh, lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
Lay down, lay down
Lay it all down
Let your white birds smile up
At the ones who stand and frown
