I have often heard you say
You love me as a friend
But I love you more than anyone
You know I can't pretend no longer
I would give you anything
I could throw my world away
But you don't want to hear that anymore
And you want to hear me say
Chorus:
Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you I know it's right
I'll always need you
I'll never leave you
Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long
I'd rather be a fool with a broken heart
Than someone who never had a part of you
You know I told you from the start
Exactly how I feel
Time goes on, seems nothing's changed
I'm in love for real
We have never played the games
That real lovers do
So maybe we are better off
Baby, I'd still like this from you
Repeat Chorus and fade
