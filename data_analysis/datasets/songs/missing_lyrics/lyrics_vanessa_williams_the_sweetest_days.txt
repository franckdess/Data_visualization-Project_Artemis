You and I
In this moment
Holding the night so close
Hanging on
Still unbroken
While outside the thunder rolls

Listen now
You can hear our heartbeat
Warm against life's bitter cold
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me
Were rattle the house like a wind
Both of ours so unbending
We battle the fear within

All the while
Life is rushing by us
Hold it now and don't let go
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

So we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars
Till they're gone
And then even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on

Listen now
You can hear our heartbeat
Hold me now and don't let go
These are the days
Every day is the sweetest day we'll know
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know
