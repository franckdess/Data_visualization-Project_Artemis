Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
Down, down (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

You oughta know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

So baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away-ay
Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Baby, don't worry (Away)
You are my only (Oh-ooh)
You won't be lonely (No)
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only (Yeah)
No need to worry (No)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down) Woo!
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down) Mmh, you down?
Even if the sky is falling down

Down, like she supposed to be, she gets down low for me
Down like her temperature, 'cause to me she zero degree
She cold, over-freeze, I got that girl from overseas
Now she my Miss America, now can I be her soldier, please?
I'm fightin' for this girl on the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me, indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy
Yeah!!

Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely (Whoa!)
Even if the sky is falling down (Falling down, baby)
You'll be my only (No-ooh)
No need to worry (No-ooh)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down? (And the sky is falling down)
(Down, down) Mmh, down (Down, down)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down? (Are you down, are you down too?)
(Down, down) Ooh, no-ooh, and the sky is falling down
Even if the sky is falling down

Ooh, no-ooh, and the sky is falling down
