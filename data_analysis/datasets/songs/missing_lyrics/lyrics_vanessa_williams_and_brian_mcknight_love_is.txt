They say it's a river that circles the earth
A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe
It conquers all
It changes everything

They say it's a blessing
They say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle, and I believe that it is
It conquers all
But it's a mystery

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily

In this world we've created
In this place that we live
In a blink of an eye, baby, the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the lovers for eternity

Love breaks the chain
Love aches for every one of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And turns it into the beauty that remains

Look at this place
It was paradise, but now it's dying
I'll pray for love
I'll take my chances that it's not too late

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away so easily

Love breaks the chain
Love aches for every one of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And turns it into the beauty that remains
