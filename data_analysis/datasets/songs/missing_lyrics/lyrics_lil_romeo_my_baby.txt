Eleven years old, makin A's and B's
And these little mami's can't keep they hands off me
When you see me in the street, holla "What's up Doc?"
I got a Bugs Bunny chain with a matchin watch
I make ya'll jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy but I live a big man's life
Got girls passin notes tryin to be my wife
Got grown women, wantin to be in my life
By the time I'm 18 I'm not gon' be nothin nice
I'm that R-O, M-E-O
After high school, I'm goin' straight to the pros (bounce, bounce)

G: Oh Romeo give me a chance

G: Walk me home from school anyway

Soldier boy I want you to myself, I don't want them girls around
You're the flyest thing up in here boy and that's why it's goin down

You must be good at hide and seek, cause boy your hard to get

G: Oh Romeo give me a chance
