Kanye, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
She gotta drink water 'cause she thirsty
She danced like 92 hundred songs back to back
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel... you know what she told me?
(Are you gonna be?) Check it out, this is what she said
(Say that you're gonna be) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh

She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

It definitely will!
You know what I told her?

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right

She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

Smokey Robinson, Smokey Robinson
Freddie Jackson, everything, everything (Well well well well)
Smokey Robinson, Ashford & Simpson (Are you gonna be)
Set the party, really set the party off right
Yes it will, yes it will (Well well well well)
Al Green, oh! Al Green, ohh yeah!
Oooh!!!
Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?

Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please? Do it faster, baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast... but I know somebody who can, Twista!

Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan Man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (Well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit' me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit' me, Chi ride
