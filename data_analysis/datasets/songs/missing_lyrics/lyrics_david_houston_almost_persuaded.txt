Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man
Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine
And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, "I need you"
"Take me away from here and be my man"
Then I've looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home
