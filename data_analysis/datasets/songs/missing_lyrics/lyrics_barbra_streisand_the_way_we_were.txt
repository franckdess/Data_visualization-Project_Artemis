Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that
It was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were
Hmmmmm hmmmmm
Hmm hmm hmmmmmm hmmm hmmm hmm hmm
Hmmm hmmm hmmmmm hmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmmm
