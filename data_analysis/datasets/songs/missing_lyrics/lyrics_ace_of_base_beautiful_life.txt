You can do what you want, just seize the day
What you're doin' tomorrow's gonna come your way
Don't you ever consider givin' up
You will find, oh oh

It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanna be here beside you
(And stay until the break of dawn)

Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child
Such a dream, whoa-oh

It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanna be here beside you
(Oh, yeah, alright!)
I just wanna be here beside you
(And stay until the break of dawn)

You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
Now and forever

It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
It's a beautiful life, oh, oh-oh-oh
I just wanna be anybody
We're living in different ways

It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you to the place
I've never been before, oh yeah
It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And fly away with you tonight
Yeah, alright!
It's a beautiful life
Yeah, alright!
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
Oh, yeah, alright!
It's a beautiful life
Oh, yeah, alright!
It's a beautiful life
Oh, yeah, alright!
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life!
