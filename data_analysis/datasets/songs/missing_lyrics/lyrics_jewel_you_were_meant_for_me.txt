I hear the clock, it's 6 a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I've got my maple syrup, everything but you

I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee, but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts bein' broken, more people being used

Put on my coat in the pourin' rain
I saw a movie, it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy, oh, I was sad, and
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business, I'm doin' fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day

I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down and then I
Take a deep breath and a good look around

Put on my PJs and hop into bed
I'm half alive, but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause

Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

Yeah, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you
