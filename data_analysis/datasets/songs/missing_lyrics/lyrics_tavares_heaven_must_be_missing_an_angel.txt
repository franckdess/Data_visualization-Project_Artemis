Heaven must be missing an angel
Missing one angel, child, cause you're here with me right now
(Your love is heavenly, baby)
(Heavenly to me, baby)
Your kiss, filled with tenderness
I want all I can get of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes in showers
And every hour on the hour
You let me feel your loving power
There's a rainbow over my shoulder (ooh, ooh)
When you came, my cup runneth over (ooh, ooh)
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear crying from above
It's cause heaven must be missing an angel
Missing one angel, child, cause you're here with me right now
(Your love is heavenly, baby)
(Heavenly to me, baby)
Ooh (heaven, heaven)
Ooh (heaven, heaven)
Ooh (heaven, heaven)
(Heaven, heaven)
Ooh, I'm captured by your spell (ooh, ooh)
You're different, girl, I can tell (ooh, ooh)
When you're laying on my pillow, baby
Above your pretty head, there's a halo, that's why I know
(Heaven) must be missing an angel
(Heaven) missing one angel, child cause you're here with me right now, mmm, ha
(Your love is heavenly, baby)
(Heavenly to me, baby)

(Heaven)
You must have slipped away along the Milky Way
It's cause (your kiss) your kiss (filled with tenderness)
You came C.O.D. on a moonbeam straight to me
Just like (showers) showers (showers, showers, showers)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
