She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind
She's got
Big thoughts
Big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl
She really wants, to be in love with a man

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love, it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
"If you have to ask, you can't afford it" lingerie
She threw him bread
And said make me scream
In the dark, what could he say?
Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said, "I need a man's man, baby"
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love, it ain't much

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret Street
They made love, and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem
She thought real love is really scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever, that's all your life
Love is Heaven sent
It's glamorous

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love, it ain't much, it ain't much


She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much
