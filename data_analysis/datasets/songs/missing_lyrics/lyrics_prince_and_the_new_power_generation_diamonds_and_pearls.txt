This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight
Why can't we just let love decide (let love decide)
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan (love is the master plan)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M (to the M)
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time (there'll come a time)
When love will blow your mind (blow your mind)
And everything you'll look for you'll find (take a look inside yeah)
That will be the time (that will be the time)
That everything will shine (forever)
So bright it makes you colorblind (you will be color blind)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (pearls, yeah yeah)
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world (give you the world)
All I can do is just offer you my love (all I can do)
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (diamonds)
Would you be, would you, would you, a happy boy or a girl
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy little baby)
If I could I would give you the world
