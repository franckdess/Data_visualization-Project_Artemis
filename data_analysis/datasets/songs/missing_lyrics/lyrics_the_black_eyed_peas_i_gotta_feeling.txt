I got a feelin'
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Feelin'
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feelin' (Wooh-ooh)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feelin' (Wooh-ooh)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (Fee-)

Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up (Fee-)
Go out and smash it like, "Oh, my God!"
Jump out that sofa, let's kick it off (Fee-)
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down, and go out, and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losin' all control
Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off (Fee-)
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again (Fee-)
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it, and do it, let's live it up
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I got a feelin' (Wooh-ooh)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feelin' (Wooh-ooh)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (Fee-)
