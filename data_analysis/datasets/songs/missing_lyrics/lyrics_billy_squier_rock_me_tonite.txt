I'm rockin' tonite--I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble--gonna grab my share
I want ya tonite--I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree
(You want it all right)...We're goin' in style
Say you walk right--you talk right--and your hair's so wild
(Snow-white)--Hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between
Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment--leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion--set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near
Take me in your arms--roll me through the night
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite
(You do it all right)--You're passion to see
You been schooled in the arts of romancin' me
(Hold tight)--You're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside
--No one's stoppin' us now--
We go down, down where the music's loud
(If it's all night)--Hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love--play it all for me
Life's never easy--we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances--fac'em side by side
Live for the moment--on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be
Take me in your arms--roll me through the night
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite
Take me in your arms
It's alright (it's alright)
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite
A time for all...and all in time
A step beyond the borderline
Of who we are and where we long to be... (yeah)
When every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away
C'mon babe
Take me in your arms--roll me through the night
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite
() Take me in your arms
It's alright (it's alright)
Take me to your heart (c'mon take me!) rock me tonite
Take me in your arms--turn me to the light
Take me to your heart
Rock me! Rock, rock, rock and rock me
Rock, rock, rock, and roll it
It's alright
Ye-yeah
Take(?) me to the light
