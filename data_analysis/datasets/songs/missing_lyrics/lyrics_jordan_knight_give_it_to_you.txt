You say it's been too long
Since you had some
You say I turn you on
Like the fire that's burning inside
You think that I'm the one, you see in your dreams
I know what you mean, yeah

It's creepin' around in your head
Me holdin' you down in my bed
You don't have to say a word
I'm convinced, you want this

Baby you know, I can give it to you
You can't deny, I'd do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Show me where, I'll taste you there
Baby you know, that I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes, when I give it to you
Without a doubt, I'll turn you out
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine

I'm the place to be
And soon, you'll see
I don't care who leads
As long, as we, move horizontally
Anyone can make you sweat
But I, can keep you wet

It's creeping around in my head
Me holding you down in my bed
I can't wait to give you some
I'm convinced, you need it

Baby you know, I can give it to you
You can't deny, I'd do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Show me where, I'll taste you there
Baby you know, that I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes, when I give it to you
Without a doubt, I'll turn you out
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine

It's creepin' around in my head
Me holding down in my bed
You dont have to say a word
Just relax
I'll do the work
I can't wait to give you some
I'm convinced, you need one

Baby you know, I can give it to you
You can't deny, I'd do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Show me where, I'll taste you there
Baby you know, that I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes, when I give it to you
Without a doubt, I'll turn you out
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine
