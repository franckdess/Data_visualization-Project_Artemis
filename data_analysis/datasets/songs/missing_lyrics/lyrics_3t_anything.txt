I'll give you love
The things you want
Ohhh... Ahh...
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you...

Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I can hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to gooo
And I would do anything for you
I would
Thinking of ways that I could win your heart
But I'm so confused, I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day when I can say that love's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

So what can I do to prove I need your love
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you gooo
Girl, I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

So if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, that's when I would do anything
I'll give you love
(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)
(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
I'll give you love
The things you want...
