Hey, my niggas, we havin' a wonderful day
And I won't front with ya, why? 'Cause it's the 1st of the month
And now we smokin', jokin', rollin' blunts
And sippin' on 40 ounces, thuggin'
Come, come, we've got the blunts and rum
From jumpin' all nights we high
Hit up the block to where? East 99
I get with my nigga to get me some yayo
Double up, "Nigga, what you need?
We got weed to get P.O.D.'d, fiend for the green leaves"
Double up for the first, fo' sho' better lay low
'Cause the po-po creep when they roll slow
If you can't get away, better toss that yayo
Keep your bankroll
Yeah, we havin' a celebration, love to stay high
And you better believe when it's time to grind
I'm down for mine, crime after crime
Fin to creep to the pad cause moms got grub on the grill
And we got the 4-0, you know it's the 1st of the month
And, my nigga, we chills for real

Wake up, and I see that my sister was already dressed
She said: "I'ma run and go get my stamps
Watch and make sure no one snatches my check"
Nigga, that's the mailman
Sort through the mail and put it up into me pocket
So I be hittin' the 99 to get me a dub for 40 duckets
But ain't no bucket ride that RTA, hop on the 10 to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid
Playa, playa, holla, holla, St. Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-Glock for some dollars
So, get a bag of yayo and a quarter O, oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut so fuck them po-po
Toss all that yayo then roll with a pound and stay low
Runnin' through the alley and into the mêlée
Up on the second the sun down
Those run from January November December
I'm lovin' the 1st of the month

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Gotta grind, gotta get mine
In the hood that I claim and I slang on that double 9-9
Gotta find them dubs
Gonna get a 40, can a thug get love?
What's up? Try to slang on my corner
Nigga, you's a goner: St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap pap
From the 1st to the 15th
Niggas smoke plenty weed but I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh
Time to roll to the pad, count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin', keepin' these niggas up off me
See, gotta search the whole block
Spend a couple of bills, thugs smoke a lot of weed on the 1st

Wakin' up, feelin' buzzed, up early mornin', stretchin', I'm yawnin'
Lightweight, bent, chugga-lugga take a 5th to the dome
Instead I kick it with my trues
But it's the 1st, so I'm gettin' me hustle on
Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know, did your O.G. check come?
Sure, put me down!
I'ma hop on the bus with Biz (yo brother, let's get drunk!)
And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of the skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the 1st come around
Now I be freakin' me Black n Mild
Headed cross town cause niggas, the 1st get celebrated
Rushin' to the block cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the 1st, just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The 1st be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease
I gotta get paid on the 1st, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs
Poetic Hustlaz and the Graveyard Shift, on the 1st
