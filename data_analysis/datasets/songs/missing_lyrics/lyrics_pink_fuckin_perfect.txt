Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's all right
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "No way, it's all good," it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean (you're so mean) when you talk (when you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (change the voices) in your head (in your head)
Make them like you instead

So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same

Whoa oh, pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time

Done looking for the critics 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves, and we do it all the time
Why do we do that, why do I do that
Why do I do that

Yeah
Oh, oh baby, pretty please

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me, yeah
You're perfect, you're perfect, oh

Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me
