Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing
Knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis
The music's like a heatwave
White lightning
Bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved
It was a sin
So sweet and true
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song
That he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone
It happened so soon
What could you do?

Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees

Black velvet if you please
If you please
If you please
If you please
