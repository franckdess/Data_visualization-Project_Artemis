Come on walk with me
Take my hand
Ooooh, oooh oooh
Ooohh, oooh oooh
(Still water)
Still water
Ahhh, ahhh, ahh

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know, ohh

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Ooooh

Walk with me
Take my hand
Still waters

Still water
Walk with me
Take my hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
