Ain't nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can do
I feel so bad, yeah
I feel so blue
I got to make it right
For everyone concerned
Even if it's me, if it means, just me
Wants getting back
'Cause I can never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, girl
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so, so very hard to go
So very hard to go
'Cause I love you so
So very hard to go
I, I love you so
I knew the time would come
I'd have to pay for my mistake
I can't blame you for what you're doin' to me girl
Even though my heart aches
Your dreams have all come true
Just the way you planned them
So I'll just step aside, I'm going to step aside
And lend a helping hand
'Cause I can never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, girl
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so very hard to go
So very hard to go
'Cause I love you so
So very hard to go
I, I love you so
I could never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, girl
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so very hard to go
So very hard to go
'Cause I love you so
So very hard to go
I, I love you so
So very hard to go
It ain't easy to walk away when a man loves somebody
So very hard to go
Hey, hey...
