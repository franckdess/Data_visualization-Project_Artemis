Everybody's looking for something
Something to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Oh! How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together
When it's love

You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessing
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Oh! How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together

(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh oh oh) You can feel it, yeah!
(Oh oh oh oh) Nothing's missing, yeah!


(Oh oh oh oh) Yeah, you can feel it
(Oh oh oh oh) Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh oh oh) When nothing's missing, ow!

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Ooh, how does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together, hey!
How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love ooh, when it's love
Hey! It'll last forever

(Na na na-ah na na)
When it's love
(Na na na-ah na na)
(Na na na-ah na na)
(Na na na-ah na na)
You and I, we're gonna feel this thing together
(Na na na-ah na na)
When it's love, ooh
When it's love, baby
You can feel it, yeah!
We'll make it last forever
Ooh-ooh, when it's love
