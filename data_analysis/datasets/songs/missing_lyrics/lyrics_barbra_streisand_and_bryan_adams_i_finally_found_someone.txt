I finally found someone
Who knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
Who makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We started off as friends
Its funny how from simple things the best things begin
This time its different, it's all because of you
Its betther than it's ever beencause we can talk it through
Ooo...my favorite linewas can i call you sometime
Its all u had to say to take my breath away
This is it
Chorus
I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one to be with every night
Cuz whatever i do it's just got to be you
My life has just beguni finally found someone
Oooh someone .i finally found somenoe
Did i keep u waiting? (i didn't mind)
I apologize (baby that's fine)
I will wait forever just to know you were mine (ooh)
You know i love your hair ( sure it looks right?)
I love what you wear (isnt it too tight?)
You're exceptionali can't wait for the rest of my life
Chorus
Ohh my life has just begun i've finally found someone
And whatever i do..it's just got to be you
Ohh my life has just begun....
