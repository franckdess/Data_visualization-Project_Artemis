Take it away
Want to hear you play till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay till there's no one else around
Take it away
Want to hear you play till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay till there's no one else around

Lonely driver
Out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor
Carrying the load
Switches on his radio

Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around
Mmmm
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around

In the audience
Watching the show
With a paper in his hand
(in his hand, in his hand)
Some important
Impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh!

Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
(Down, down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around

You never know who
May be listening to you
(Never know who
May be listening to you
You never know who
May be listening to you)
Take it away
Take it away

After hours
Late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers
Wade in the jar
Till the evening is complete

(Hah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)

(Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)
