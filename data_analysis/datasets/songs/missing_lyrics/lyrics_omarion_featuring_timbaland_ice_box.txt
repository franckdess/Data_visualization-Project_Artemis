Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again
I know that, it's my fault, but you don't understand
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my niggas
I should try, truth is I wanna let u in, but no
Damn these memories, and it's crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know

Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this...

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (But I got this...)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this...)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (But I got this...)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this...)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Why can't I get it right, just can't let it go
I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more
I got memories, this is crazy
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it
Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
And I, I apologize, for makin' you cry
Look me in my eye and promise you won't do me the same

Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this...

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (But I got this...)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this...)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (But I got this...)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this...)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold cold world (Cause I don't wanna be...)
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl (x3)
I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold cold world (Cause I don't wanna be...)
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl (x3)

Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'

I got this icebox where my heart used to be (Said I got this...)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
