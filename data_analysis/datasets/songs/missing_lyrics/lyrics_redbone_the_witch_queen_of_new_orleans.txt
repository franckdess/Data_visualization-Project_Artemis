(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She'll put a spell on you
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She'll put a spell on you
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She's the Witch Queen ah
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans
I'm gonna tell you a story
Strange as it now seem
Of zombie voodoo, gris gris
And the Witch Queen of New Orleans
She lived in a world of magic
Possessed by the devil's skew
From a shack near the swampland with a mud-pie brick
Marie stirred her witch's brew
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She'll put a spell on you
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She'll put a spell on you
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She's the Witch Queen ah
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans
Dime or a nickel any one could buy
Voodoo of any kind
She had potions and lotions, herbs and tanna leaves
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew
Vanished Marie with hate in her eye
Though she'll never return all the Cajuns knew
A witch queen never die
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She'll put a spell on you
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She'll put a spell on you
(Marie, Marie La, Voodoo, Veau)
She's the Witch Queen ah
Of New Orleans. of New Orleans
