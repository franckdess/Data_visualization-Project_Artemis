Yeah, girl, I don't want you to hold back any longer, baby
'Cause tonight, I'm gonna give you all the things
I know you've been waiting for
So, brace yourself, and listen

I hear you calling, here I come, baby, to save you, oh oh
Baby, no more stalling, these hands have been longing to touch you, baby, woo
And now that you've come around, to seeing it my way
You won't regret it, baby, and you surely won't forget it, baby
It's unbelievable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it calling, calling, calling for me

My body's calling for you (baby, I can hear it calling, baby)
My body's calling for you (your body's calling me)
My body's calling for you (oh, oh)
My body's calling for you (come on, baby)

Tell me, what's your desire, baby, your wish is my will, oh yes, it is
Baby, let me take you higher and show you how you should feel, baby
Oh, so I speak now and forever hold your body
Whatever it is you want from me, lady
You see you don't have to say nothing, I know when your body wants something
And it's easy for me to see that your body's calling for me

My body's calling for you (oh, oh, I hear it calling me)
My body's calling for you (I can hear it calling me)
My body's calling for you (oh, oh, oh, calling me)
My body's calling for you (yeah, yeah)

I'm listening, baby, I hear you calling me
I'm listening, baby, I hear you calling me
I'm listening, baby, I hear you calling me
I'm listening, baby, I hear you calling me
Hear your body calling me

My body's calling for you (oh, I hear you calling me, yeah)
My body's calling for you (I hear you calling me, oh, oh)
My body's calling for you (I can just hear you calling me, yeah)
My body's calling for you
My body's calling for you (see your body's yearning, yeah, yearning for me)
My body's calling for you (and I like it, baby, it's yearning for me)
My body's calling for you (yes, it is, you see I'm wild enough to know)
My body's calling for you (when a body's yearning, for me, yeah)
My body's calling for you (I wanna say it again)
My body's calling for you (see I'm wild enough to know, when a body's yearning, for me)
My body's calling for you (yeah)
