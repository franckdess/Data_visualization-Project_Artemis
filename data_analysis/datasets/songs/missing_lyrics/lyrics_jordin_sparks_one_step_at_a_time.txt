Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything
That you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste, but you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
(No one knows your name yet)
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face, and the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated (Frustrated)
And you're getting all kind of impatient (Impatient)
Waitin' (Waitin')

We live and we learn
To take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love (Just falling in love)
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen
Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused
And got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
(No one knows your name yet)
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it (Make it)
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face, and the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated (Frustrated)
And you're getting all kind of impatient
Waitin' (Waitin')

We live and we learn
To take one step at a time
There's no need to rush (No need to rush)
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love (Just falling in love)
It's gonna happen when it's supposed to happen
(It's gonna happen)
Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time

When you can't wait any longer (You can't wait)
But there's no end in sight (Ooh, oh)
(When you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way we get there
Is one step at a time

Oh, take one step at a time
There's no need to rush (No need to rush)
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love (Falling in love)
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time
One step at a time
There's no need to rush (No need to rush)
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love (Just falling in love)
It's gonna happen (It's gonna happen)
When it's supposed to happen
Then we find the reasons why
One step at a time
