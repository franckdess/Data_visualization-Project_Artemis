I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me? At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

Yeah, I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (Takes you home, babe)
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
