At these up late times, hardcore funkateers before the bop gun
We unleash you a positive light. The bop gun can do you no harm
It frees yo mind, so yo' behind can follow. (Yeahhh.)
So wide you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it
So high you can't get over it
IIIIIIII, can't get over it
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit

Well all right!
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit
Attention all radio station jocks
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit
Haw haw, got to be groovin' jammin' on yo box
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit
The Mothership Connection is upon you again
Ah yaaaaaa, di-dit-dit-dit-dit
Yeah, workin' up a sweat, is it wet yet?
Ready or not, here we come
Getting down for the one which we believe in

1993, much more ba-e-ya-e-younce
Ice Cube comin' with the half ounce
Not Just Knee Deep, Jeep fulla smog
A, To, mic, Dog
Like ya behind, heard it through the grapevine
How much longer will you be mine?
And I'mma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama
Cause Bertha Butt did her fuckin' boogie with her crew
But I'd rather fuck you, boo
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' shit
One nation under a groove gettin down for the fuck of it
Tear the roof of this motherfucker like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun

Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constriction
Gonna be freakin' up and down
Hang up really late
The groove I only got
We shall all be moved
Ready or not, here we come
Gettin down for the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
Gettin down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin can stop us now
{Yeah.}
Dance, sucka, dance!
{Yeah, heh heh. And it don't stop. Sheeeit.}
Givin' you more of what you're funkin' for
Aw, feet don't fail me now! Ha ha!
Givin' you more of what you're funkin' for
Do you promise the funk {yep}, the whole funk
Nothin but the funk?
{Hit you with the bop gun, heh
Buss a cap with my bop gun
Gotta hit you with the bop gun
Buss a cap with the bop gun, hit you with the bop gun
Buss a cap with the bop gun, heh, cause I'm the top gun...}
Ready. {yep} Ready. {yep} Ready. {yep, come on}
Ready or not, here we come
Gettin down on the one which we believe in

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin with our toys
M-1, cuz everybody's gotta have fun
Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get fucked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
You let her funk me cause my funk is the best
Comin from the West
Kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin them dips, cd skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say
"Do that stuff! Aw, do that stuff!"
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun
One nation under a groove
Gettin down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin can stop us now
{Trick! Yeeah!} Jus hit 'em with the bop gun!
One nation under a groove {heh}
Gettin down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin can stop us now
{Get up with the bop gun...}
One nation under a groove ('bout time we got down, one time)
Gettin down just for {the fuck of it, yeahh}
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin can stop us now
One nation under a groove (now everybody say)
Gettin down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin can stop us now

Givin' you more of what you're funkin' for
Ooo, feet don't fail me now
Can I get it on my good foot, good gawd
'Bout time I got down one time
(Can I get down one time)

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got Daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole
Now I'll big bang you with my black pole
Flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some funwith the bop gun

(Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in)
