If you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid baby
Just ask me
You know I'm gonna give it to you
Oh and I do declare (I do)
I wanna see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy
You're gonna get it
'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
I love you I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby I love you
If you feel you wanna kiss me
Go right ahead I don't mind
All you got to do is
Snap your fingers
And I'll come runnin'
I ain't lyin' (I ain't lyin')
And I heard you once
Little boy you know you got it
I'd deny my own self
Before I see you without it
'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
I love you I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby I love you
Someday you might want to run away
And leave me sitting here crying
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye
(Goodbye)
Baby I love you
(Baby baby I love you)
Baby I need you
(Baby, baby I...)
Said I want you
(Baby, baby I...)
Got to have you baby
(Baby, baby I...)
Don't let your neighbors
(Baby, baby) Tell you
I don't want you
(Baby, baby)
Don't let you...
