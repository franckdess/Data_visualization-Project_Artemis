She's got somethin' that moves my soul
And she knows
I'd love to love her
But she lets me down every time
Can't make her mine
She's no one's lover
Tonight with me she'll be so invitin'
I want her all for myself
Oh, temptation eyes
Lookin' through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight
Got to love me, baby, yeah, mm-hmm
Her wild-eyed innocence is just a game
But just the same
My head is spinnin'
She's got a way to keep me on her side
It's just a ride
It's never-endin'
Tonight with me she'll be so excitin'
I want her all for myself
Oh, temptation eyes
Lookin' through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight
Do you feel it now?
Tonight with me she'll be so excitin'
I want her all for myself
Oh, temptation eyes
Lookin' through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight
Temptation eyes
Lookin' through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
Come on, love me, love me tonight
Temptation eyes
Lookin' through my, my, my soul
