Ooh, hoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My, my, my, my

Black pearl, precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong
Black pearl, pretty little girl
You been in the background much too long

You been working so hard your whole life through
Tending other people's houses, raising up their children too
Hey, how about something for me and you
Here in my arms you're gonna reign supreme
No more serving, baby, they're gonna serve my queen
It's our turn for happiness and our day has come
Living for each other, answering to no one

Black pearl, precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong
'Cause I love you
Black pearl, pretty little girl
You been in the background much too long

Together we'll stand so straight and so tall
Created by love to love one and all, hey
Heart to heart, soul to soul
No other woman could ever take your place
My world is built around the very smile that's on your face
You'll never win a beauty show, no, they won't pick you
But you're my Miss America, I love you

Black pearl, precious little girl
Let me put you up where you belong
I need you
Black pearl, pretty little girl
You been in the background much too long

Ooh, hoo, yeah, yeah, yeah
My, my, my, my babe
You know I need you
You know I want to keep you for myself
And, I don't want nobody else
Now, baby, I love you
You know I need you
You know I got to, got to
Got to have you, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, come on
Come on and be my baby
You know I love you
I don't need nobody else
Let me put you up
Where you belong
Let me take you on up
Come on baby, love
I love you, and I need you, and I want you
Want you for myself
