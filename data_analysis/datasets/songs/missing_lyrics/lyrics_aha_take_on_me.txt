Is it the voice of an angel
Or just the sound of sweet temptation
Luring my imagination, aha aha aha
Is it the doorway to heaven
Or just forbidden fruit sensation
Promising new revelation, aha aha aha
Take me away on your wings of desire
Take me away through the winds of fire
Through the winds of fire
Is it eternal emotion
Or just a moment of devotion
Falling like a drop in the ocean, aha aha aha
Take me away on your wings of desire
Take me away through the winds of fire
Through the winds of fire, through the winds of fire
Take me away
Is it the voice of an angel
Or just the sound of sweet temptation
Luring my imagination, aha aha aha
Take me away on your wings of desire
Take me away through the winds of fire
Through the winds of fire, through the winds of fire
Take me away through the winds of fire, take me away
