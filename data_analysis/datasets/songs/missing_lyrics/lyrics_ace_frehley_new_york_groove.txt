Many years since I was here
On the street I was passin' my time away
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky
It's outta sight in the dead of night
(Ooh) Here I am, and in this city
(Ooh) With a fistful of dollars
And baby, you'd better believe
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove
In the back of my Cadillac
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' "Where are we?"
Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me
(Ooh) I feel so good tonight
(Ooh) Who cares about tomorrow
So baby, you'd better believe
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
