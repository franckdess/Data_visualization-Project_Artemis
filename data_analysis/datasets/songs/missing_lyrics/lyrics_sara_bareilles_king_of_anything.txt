Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside

So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked

So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

I hate to break it you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Oh...

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
You swear you know best

But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you and ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction, oh
But you'll ever see

You're so busy makin' maps
With my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

All my life
I've tried
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt
And hide
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide

Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Who cares if you disagree
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Let me hold your crown, babe
Oh oh, ooh
Ah...
