Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

You took me from the shelter of my Mother
I had never known or love any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night of the honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms
I'd wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'd walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were just here, here with me
Ohhhhhhhhh...

Doncha know that I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon that you'd walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
