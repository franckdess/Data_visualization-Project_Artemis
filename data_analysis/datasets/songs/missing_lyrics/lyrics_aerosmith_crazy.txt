Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

That kinda loving
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
I need your love, honey
I need your love

Crazy, crazy, crazy, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
You turn it on, then your gone
Yeah you drive me
