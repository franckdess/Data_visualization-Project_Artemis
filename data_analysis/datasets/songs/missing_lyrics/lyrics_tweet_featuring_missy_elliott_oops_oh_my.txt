We ain't goin' nowhere

I'll tell ya what I did last night
I came home, say around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance, from this body
So buttery brown and tantalizing
You would have thought I needed help
From the feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

OOPS! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
OOPS! There goes my skirt droppin to my feet, oh my
OOH! Some kind of touch caressing my face, oh my
OOH! I'm turnin' red who could this be

I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallow my pride, let it ride
And partied, but this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath
