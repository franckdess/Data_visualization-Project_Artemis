You caught me fooling around with somebody new
You caught me fooling around now I'm losing you
'Cause you're a one man woman
You're a one man woman
You're a one man woman
But I'm a two timing man
The nights you left me alone
And you disappeared
The nights your voice on the phone
Said I'm waiting here
'Cause I'm a one man woman
You're a one man woman
I'm a one man woman
But I'm a two timing man
Oh Baby you know I'm sorry
Oh sure, it's the same old story
I keep coming back
And I let you
Cause I'd rather forgive than forget you
Now I won't need no chains to tie me down
You lost you're way my fault
But now you've found that
'Cause I'm a one man woman
You're a one man woman
I'm a one man woman
But I'm a two timing man
I'm a one man woman
I'll be a one woman man
You're a one man woman
I'm a one woman man
Yes, you're a one man woman
You're a one woman man...
