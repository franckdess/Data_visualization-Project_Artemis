(Chuck D: Here we go again)

Well, I'm out to have a real good time
And now you wanna try to fade me
But friends of yours are friends of mine
So don't even try to play me
If you don't have nothing good to say
The words you will be withholding
These kinds of games a girl will play
Just like mother told me, so

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Now this ain't the time to make a scene
Because I'm out with my homies
I know you know just what I mean
So don't just walk up on me
There's a time and there's a place
Where we can talk about it
'Cause I don't want to be disgraced
With all your screams and shouting, but

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Climb the mountain
(What mountain?)
Swim the sea
(What sea?)
See what I mean?
(No)
I don't know but I don't want to get too deep
(Here we go again)
Ah, oh, ah, no (Here we go)
Ah, oh, ah, no (No, not again, baby)
Ah, oh, ah, no (Here we go)
Ah, oh
Here we go again

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Now there's no need to explain
You know how I feel about you
So don't you take my words in vain
You know I can't live without you
I need some time to unwind
So try to be understanding
I hope that you would change your mind
Instead of being so demanding, 'cause

Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)
Yo, kick it
Ah (Here we go)
Ah, ah (Yo, Portrait, there she goes)
(Here we go again)
Ah, ah, ah, here we go again
