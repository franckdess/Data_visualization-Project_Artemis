Every boy's the same since up in the seventh grade
They've been tryna get with me
Tryna ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
They always got a plan to be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
I keep turning them down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around, that's not the way it's going down

'Cause they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah

Don't mean yes, it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute, let me put my two cents in it
One; just be patient
Don't be rushin' like you're anxious
And two; you're just too aggressive
Tryna get your ahhh

Do you know... that I know?
And I don't... wanna go there...
Yeah they only want, only want
My ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah
