Your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin', woman I feel it fade

Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh babe, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's there everywhere
Baby, baby, babe, I'm losing you

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face, I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me
It's all over your face
Someone's takin' my place
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Ooh babe, I'm losing you

I can't bear the thought of losing you
Ah woman, can't you see what I'm goin' through
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't bear the thought of losing you
I'm losin' my mind, losin' my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't stand the thought of losing you
