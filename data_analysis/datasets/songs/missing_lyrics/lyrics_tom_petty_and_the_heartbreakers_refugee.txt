We got somethin', we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it

Listen, it don't really matter to me, baby
You believe what you want to believe

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me why you wanna lay there
And revel in your abandon

Honey, it don't make no difference to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)

Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things
You got to feel to be true

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped
Tied up, taken away, and held for ransom

Honey, it don't really matter to me, baby
Everybody's had to fight to be free

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
No, you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
You don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
