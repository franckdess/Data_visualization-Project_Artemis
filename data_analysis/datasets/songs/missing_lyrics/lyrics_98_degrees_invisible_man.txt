Hoh hoh hoh
Yeah

You can hardly wait to tell all your friends
How his kisses taste sweet like wine
And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
Every time he walks by
And if you're feeling down
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close when you're makin' love
He's everything you've been dreaming of
Oh baby

I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive (oh hoh hoh)
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man (yeah)
(Ohoh, you don't see me baby)

You probably spend hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all (talkin' 'bout nothing at all)
It doesn't matter what the conversation
Just as long as he called (ohhhhh)
Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
And you wipe away each other's tears (all of those tears)
Your face lights up whenever he appears
Ohhhhhh

I wish you'd look at me that way (look at me that way)
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine (deep into mine)
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive (you, don't, know, that I'm alive)
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man (you don't see me)

I see you all the time baby (you don't see me)
The way you look at him (you don't see me)
I wish it was me sweetheart
Boy I wish it was me
But I guess I'll never be...

I wish you'd look at me that way
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine (deep into mine)
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive (you don't even know I'm alive)
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man

I wish you'd look at me that way (look at me that way)
Your beautiful eyes lookin' deep into mine (deep into mine)
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive (hoh, no no no)
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man

Hoh hoh hoh
Oh baby
The invisible man
You don't see me girl
But I love you
Yes I love you
The invisible man
Hoh hoh hoh
Yeah yeah
The invisible man
Baby baby baby
Yeah
The invisible man
