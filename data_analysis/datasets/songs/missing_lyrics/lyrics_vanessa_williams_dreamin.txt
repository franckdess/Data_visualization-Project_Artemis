Now I'm living in a middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy

For the life of me
I never thought that it could be
The way it stands right now
Emotions running high
Every night I wish
That I could tell you how I feel

Those words are here in my heart
Oh, but there is
Just one missing part
How to put it together
How to say it right
And let you know that
Every night

I'll be dreamin'
Dreamin'
Hoping, baby
You will be there
I'll be dreamin'
Dreamin'
Hoping, baby
You will be there

Let me take time out
To try and find out
If this could be real
'Cause reality scares me
I've been living a fantasy
How should I feel
