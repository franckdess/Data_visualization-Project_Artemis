The cotton wood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive and a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime

Well if you ain't a ten, you're a 9.9
Tippin' and spillin' that homemade wine on your tied-up, t-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild, throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God Al-mighty
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom

Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime

So, let's slip on out, where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take off on out in the water

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans

Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime
Girl, I'm a little drunk on you
