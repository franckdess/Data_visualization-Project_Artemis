You don't know how you met me, you don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you, I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

I'm not worried 'bout the ring you wear
'Cause as long as no one knows, then nobody can care
You're feelin' guilty and I'm well aware
But you don't look ashamed, and baby I'm not scared
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

Won't give you money, I can't give you the sky
You're better off if you don't ask why
I'm not the reason that you go astray and
We'll be alright if you don't ask me to stay

(Follow me, everything is alright)
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me

You don't know how you met me, you don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you, I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea(17837211)
