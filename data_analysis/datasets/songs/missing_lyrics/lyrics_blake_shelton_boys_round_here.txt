Red-red-red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck

Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what
(That's right)
Yeah, and what they call work, diggin' in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four-wheel drive
A country boy can survive

Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aww, heck
Red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck

Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?)
Nah, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here, yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aww, heck
Red-Red-Red-Red-Red-Red-Redneck

Ooh, let's ride
Ooh, let's ride
Down to the river side

Ooh, let's ride
Hey now girl, hop inside
Me and you gon' take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (That's right)
Ooh, let's ride

Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

With, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Ooh, let's ride
