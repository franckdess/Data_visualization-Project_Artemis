Love, like a road that never ends
How it leads me back again
To heartache
I'll never understand
Darling I put my heart up on the shelf
Till the moment was right
And I told myself
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you
Oh now as I look into your eyes
Well I wonder if it's wise
To hold you
Like I've wanted to before
Tonight ooh I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
(It will be with you)
Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you
