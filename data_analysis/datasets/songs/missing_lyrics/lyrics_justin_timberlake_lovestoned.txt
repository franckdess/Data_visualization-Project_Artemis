Hey! Uh
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it
Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle, she likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom, it sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And, she looks like a model, except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother, unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
Yeah

She shuts the room down the way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town, she's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare (Cause a glare)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (I had to stop and stare)
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows

Now dance
Get it, girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this song one time

Ow!

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh



Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
(Those flashing lights come from everywhere)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (Stop and stare)
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care (Without a care)
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love stoned and I could swear that she knows
I think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh

Mmmm, mmm
Oh, oh
Mmmm, mmm
Mmmm, mmm
Mmmm, hmmm
