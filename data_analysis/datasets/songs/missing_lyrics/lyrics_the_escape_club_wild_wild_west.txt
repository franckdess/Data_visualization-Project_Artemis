Forty seven dead beats living in the back street
North, east, west, south, all in the same house
Sitting in a back room, waiting for the big boom
I'm in a bedroom waiting for my baby
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west (wild west)
Well, Mandy's in the backroom, handing out Valium
Sheriff's on the airwaves, talking to the D.J.'s
Forty seven heartbeats beating like a drum
Got to live it up, live it up, Ronnie's got a new gun
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west (wild west) Yeow
Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down
You can live it up, live it up all over the town
And turn to the left, turn to the right
I don't care as long as she comes tonight
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we love best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west (wild west)
Yeow, wild west
Brrrr, here come a musical disc
'Cause some people them a-keep waitin' for
This one's called the outlaw, wow
They want me
Ride the rhythm like me ridin' a bike
Shine on me
Murder me chatter when me chat on the mic
Shorties thought this could keep them rockin' 'til the broad daylight
And here comes the Escape Club to rock it all night, say
Live it up, live it up
Live it up, live it up
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
(Wild west)
Heading for the nineties, living in the eighties
Screaming in a back room, waiting for the big boom
Give me, give me wild west, give me, give me safe sex
Give me love, give me love, give me time to live it up
Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down
You can live it up, live it up all over the town
And turn to the left, turn to the right
I don't care as long as she comes tonight
She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we like best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west (wild west)
Yeow, wild west
