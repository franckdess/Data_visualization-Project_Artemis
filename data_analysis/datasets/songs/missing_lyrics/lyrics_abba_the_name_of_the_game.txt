I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game

I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)

Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
Oh, yes, I wanna know
