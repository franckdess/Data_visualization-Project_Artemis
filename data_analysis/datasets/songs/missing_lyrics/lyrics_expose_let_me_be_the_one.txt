Sometimes people play with love
Falling in love is just a game
Don't think
I don't know love
You'll never be alone again
(Let me)
Show you how I feel
(Be the one)
That I need so much
(Let me)
Give you what is real
(Be the one)
That I long to touch
Only you can make me feel this way
I give you all
Come on
Let's get away
This love I feel
Will never, ever fade
I give you more and more
So

(Let me be the one)
To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one)
You can trust me at any time
(Let me be the one)
Give you all my love
(Let me be the one)
To feel your tender touch

The first time
That I saw you there
Thought I knew you from before
Promise me you will never leave
Cause I will never let you go
(Let me)
Hold you close to me
(Be the one)
Because our love is strong
(Let me)
Fill the need in me
(Be the one)
Together, we belong
Only you can make me feel brand new
I can feel it in my heart
Your love is true
Together
We are one instead of two
I want you more and more
So

(Let me be the one)
To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one)
You can trust me at any time
(Let me be the one)
I want to give you all my love
(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one

Only you can make me feel this way
I give you all
Come on
Let's get away
This love I feel
Will never, ever fade
I give you more and more
So

(Let me be the one)
To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one)
You can trust me at any time
(Let me be the one)
To give you all my love
(Let me be the one)
And feel your tender touch
(Let me be the one)
To hold on to the dream
(Let me be the one)
You can trust me at any time
