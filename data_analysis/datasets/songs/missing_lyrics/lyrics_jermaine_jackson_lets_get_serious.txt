Close my eyes, and I see your face at night
Toss and turn, fall to sleep holding my pillow tight
All the time I think of you, you're with me no matter what I do
Walk around with a smile upon my face
In my mind, you have taken up permanent space
I am feeling what I can't explain, and if what you're feeling is the same
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
S.E.R.I.O.U.S
Baby let's get serious
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
In your arms is the place I wanna be
With my love in you, and your love inside of me
Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we've got so much we wanna share
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious
Let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Both of us feel like exploding, 'cos this stuffs too hot for holding
Let's get serious and fall in love
Girl you've got my body moaning, just believe it's ment for cloning
Let's get serious and fall in love
Serious, (oh) serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
