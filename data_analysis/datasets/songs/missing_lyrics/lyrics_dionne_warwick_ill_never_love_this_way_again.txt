You looked inside my fantasies
And made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one
Since you took me in
I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow
Reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow
If you should go away
I'll stand here and remember
Just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on
I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on
