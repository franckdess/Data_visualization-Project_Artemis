Aw, Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
We're gonna ride
Till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
And Lord, don't you know
We'll have me a time with a poor man's lady
Hitchin' on a twilight train
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
Maybe a song
To sing when I want
No need to say please to no man
For a happy tune
Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose
You're a store-bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now, play it now
Play it now, my baby
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
We got all night to set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions
Yeah
Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose
You're a store-bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now, play it now
Play it now, my baby
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
We got all night
To set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions
Ba ba ba ba ba ......
