No more running down the wrong road
Dancing to a different drum
Can`t you see what`s going on
Deep inside your heart?
Always searching for the real thing
Living like it's far away
Just leave all the madness in yesterday
You're holding the key when you believe it
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
Smiling with the rising sun
Living like we've never known
Going all the way
Reaching out to meet the changes
Touching every shining star
The light of tomorrow
It's right where we are
There's no turning back from what I'm feeling
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on
Cause they'll be starlight all night
When it comes together
Share those feelings
Dancing in your eyes
Tonight they're guiding us
Shining til the morning light
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic, magic, baby
Oh, sweet freedom
Carry me along
We'll keep the spirit
Alive, on and on
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
Shine, sweet freedom
Carry me along
Shine your light on me
We'll keep the spirit
Alive, on and on
Shine, sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You are the magic, babe
