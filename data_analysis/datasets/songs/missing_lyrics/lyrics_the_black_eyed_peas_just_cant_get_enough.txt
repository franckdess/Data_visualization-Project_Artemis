Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Honey got her sexy on steaming
She's give my hotness a new meaning
Perfection, mami you gleaming
Inception, you got a brother dreaming, dreaming
Damn, baby, I'm fiendin
I'm tryna holla at you, I'm screaming
Let me love you down this evening
Lovie lovie, yeah, you know you are my demon
Girl, we can form a team, and
I could be the King, you could be the Queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleaning
I love you long time so you know the meaning

Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signs her name on my heart with an "XO"
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime, I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm...
Something 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin like Mr. Robotoâ€‹

Oh, baby, I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feeling high, and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jam inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

This is mega switch-up
Switch-up, switch-up
I just can't switch-up

Locked, sunk in your bedrock
Heart, pumpin' your love-shot
Knocked, out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your headlock (Switch up)
Can't stop, won't quit
Makin' me fiend, give it to me
I want it all, you know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (Switch up)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (Switch up)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory

I just can't switch-up
