It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I'll cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling

You know that
There'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight

I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star
