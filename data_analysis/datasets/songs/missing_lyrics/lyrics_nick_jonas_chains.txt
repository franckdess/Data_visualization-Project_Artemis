With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she’s warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She takes 'til I break and I can’t get more

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

Alone in the night ‘til she knocks on my door, oh no
Wasted again, but I can’t say no, whoa

Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul

You got me in chains (Oh baby)
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change (I wouldn’t change)
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change (I wouldn’t change)
No, I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me chains (Oh baby)
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
