Any day now
I will hear you say
Good bye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be all alone
Any day now
When your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now, when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now, love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Any day now
You won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around
