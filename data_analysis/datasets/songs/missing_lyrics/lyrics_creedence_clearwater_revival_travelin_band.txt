737 coming out of the sky
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride

I want to move
Playing in a travelin' band
Yeah!
Well, I'm flying across the land, trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelin' band

Take me to the hotel, baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on, won't you get me to my room

I want to move
Playing in a travelin' band
Yeah!
Well, I'm flying across the land, trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelin' band

Listen to the radio talking about the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia

I want to move
Playing in a travelin' band
Yeah!
Well, I'm flying across the land, trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelin' band
Wow!

Here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussing and your fighting won't you get me to the right

I want to move
Playing in a travelin' band
Yeah!
Well I'm flying across the land trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelin' band
WEELL!

Oh! I'm playing in a travelin' band
Playing in a travelin' band
Won't you get me, take me hand
Well, I'm playing in a travelin' band
Well, I'm flying 'cross the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelin' band
Wow!
Hey!
