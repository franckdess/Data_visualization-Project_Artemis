They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family
They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

Now I was cold coolin', you know (maxin' and relaxin')
Just kickin' it around the house (Oaktown kicking' it)
When a knock, a knock, a knock and a voice yo!
Can Hammer come out? (what's up?)
Now I don't mind (mind) being a friend
And showin' a little bit of flava (flava)
But Wednesday, Pugsley, Gomez, Fester (oh man)
Man, them some strange neighbours

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family
They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

I remember the day I needed to borrow
A little of pepper (for my chicken)
The next thing you know, comin' at me
Was a hand with the fingers high steppin' (I ain't with that)
Now I tried to play it along (you know)
And act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha)
But what do I see (yo) a perm with feet (Cousin It)
Standin' about three feet tall (I'm outta here)

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family
They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

Speakin' and thinkin' about the Addams
You know the Hammer is with it (I'm with it)
Act A Fool, No Bones, Swoop, Goofy, and Randy
You know we kick it (the posse)
Now is the time to get in your mind
It's ok to be yourself (be yourself)
Take foolish pride and put it aside
Like the Addams, yo! They def (that's a family!)

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family
They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
The Addams Family

And he got to wibblin' and wobblin'
And he did this cool new turn move he had
Everybody backed up, you know what I'm saying
He backed them up
