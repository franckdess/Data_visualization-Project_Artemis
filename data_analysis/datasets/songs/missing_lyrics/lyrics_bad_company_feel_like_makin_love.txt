Baby, when I think about you
Think about love
Darlin', don't live without you
And your love
If I had, those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you, in the heaven
'Til I'm dyin' (dyin', dyin',)
On the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you
I Think about love
Darlin', if I live without you
I live without love
And if I had, the sun and moon
They were shinin' (shinin')
I would give you, both night and day
Of satisfyin'

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you


And if I had, those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you, in the heaven
'Til I'm dyin' (dyin', dyin',)
On the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Well I feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
