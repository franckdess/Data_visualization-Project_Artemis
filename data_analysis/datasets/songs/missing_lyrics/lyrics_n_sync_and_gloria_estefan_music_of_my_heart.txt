You'll never know what you've done for me
What your faith in me has done for my soul
You'll never know the gift you've given me
I'll carry it with me yeah, yeah
Through the days ahead
I think of days before
You made me hope for something better
(Yes, you did)
And made me reach for something more

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Help me hear the music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes
You've opened the door
To something I've never known before
And your love (love)
Is the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)

You were the one always on my side
(Always on my side)
Always standing by (always standing by)
Seeing me through
You were the song that always made me sing
(Made me sing, made me sing)
I'm singing this for you
(Singing this for you, baby)
Everywhere I go, I think of where I've been
(Think of where I've been)
And of the one who knew me better
Than anyone ever will again

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
Help me hear the music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart
He-he-heart
You've opened my eyes
You've opened the door
(You opened the door)
To something I've never known before
And your love (your love)
Is the music of my heart

What you taught me
Only your love could ever teach me
You got through when no one could reach me
(Ohh, ohh, ohh)
Cause you always saw in me
All the best that I could be
It was you who set me free

You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside (me inside)
Help me hear the music of my heart
Help me hear the music of my heart
You taught me to run
You taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside (me inside)
Help me hear the music of my heart
(Music of my heart)
Help me hear the music of my heart
You've opened my eyes
You've opened the door
(Opened the door)
To something I've never known before
(Never, never, felt before)
And your love
Is the music of my heart

Music of my heart
Music of my heart
Is the music of my heart
