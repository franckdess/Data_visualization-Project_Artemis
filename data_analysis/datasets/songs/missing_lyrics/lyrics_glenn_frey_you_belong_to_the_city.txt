The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it
Starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat
The traffic roars
The sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed
You still don't know
Where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
Cause you can take it
(Alternate Chorus)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong
You belong
