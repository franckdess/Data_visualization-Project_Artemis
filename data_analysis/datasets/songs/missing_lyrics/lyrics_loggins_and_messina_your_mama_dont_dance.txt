Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?

The old folks say
That ya gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late it's a sin
There just ain't no excusin'
You know you're gonna lose and never win
I'll say it again

And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?

You pull into a drive-in
And find a place to park
You hop into the backseat
Where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to move-in
Thinkin' it's a breeze
There's a light in your eyes
And then a guy says
"Out of the car longhair"
"Louie, you're comin' with me"
"The local police"

And it's all because
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance
And your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go
To rock and roll?
Where do you go
To rock and roll?
Where do you go
To rock and roll?
