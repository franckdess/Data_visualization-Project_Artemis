Darkest of night with the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
The game he plays, he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all
Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh
The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
"Can't be like the rest" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Super Fly
Super Fly
Super Fly
Super Fly
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
