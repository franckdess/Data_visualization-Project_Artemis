Well I've walked these streets
A virtual stage
It seemed to me
Makeup on their faces
Actors took their places next to me

Well I've walked these streets
In a carnival
Of sights to see
All the cheap thrill-seekers
The vendors and the dealers
They crowded around me

Have I been blind?
Have I been lost?
Inside myself and my own mind?
Hypnotized, mesmerized
By what my eyes have seen

Well I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet
That they just rolled out for me

And I've walked these streets
In the madhouse asylum
They can be
Where a wild-eyed misfit prophet
On a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me

Have I been blind?
Have I been lost?
Inside myself and my own mind?
Hypnotized, mesmerized
By what my eyes have seen
Have I been wrong?
Have I been wise?
To shut my eyes and play along?
Hypnotized, paralyzed
By what my eyes have found
By what my eyes have seen
What they have seen

Have I been blind?
Have I been lost?
Have I been wrong?
Have I been wise?
Have I been strong?
Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized
By what my eyes have found?
In that great street carnival
In that carnival
Have I been blind?
Have I been lost?
Have I been wrong?
Have I been wise?
Have I been strong?
Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized
By what my eyes have found?
In that great street carnival
In that carnival
