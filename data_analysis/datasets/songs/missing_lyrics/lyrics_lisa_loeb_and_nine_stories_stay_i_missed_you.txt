You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time.  So?
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
And you say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
Or to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no (bad)
And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song:
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well.  Well, this is not that:
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown
And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you
You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, "hey, I can leave, I can leave."
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said you caught me ‘cause you want me
And one day you’d let me go
You try to give away a keeper, but keep me cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, "Stay."
And you say I only hear what I want to
