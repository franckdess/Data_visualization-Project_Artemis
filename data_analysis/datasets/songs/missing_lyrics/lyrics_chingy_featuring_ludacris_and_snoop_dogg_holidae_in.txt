(Whachu doing?) Nothing chilling at the Holiday Inn!
(Who you with?) Me and my peeps thought you'd bring over your friends
(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

Peeps call me up  said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: "wassup?"
I told em: "follow me". they knew I had it cracking B
One said "ain't you that boy that be on BET?"
"Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling"
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout "that's that dude that sing "Right Thurr" - he glistening"
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gonna hit, aww shit

Ma showed up like "what's the hold up?"
Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said "can I be in yo video" I'm like "yeah!", "oh really?"
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

(Whachu doing?) Nothing chilling at the Holiday Inn!

Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on your nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, with a bowl of Tender Vittles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm with Chingy, at the Holiday Inn

Yeah, let the party begin, bitch
Ching-a-ling Ling, all the way in St. Louis
My nigga Chingy, Disturbing Tha Peace
Luda, Luda, going hard on you hoes
Yeah bitch, bring four of ya friends
Meet me at the Holiday Inn
Bring a gang of that Hen, some VSOP
Ooh wee! And light that sticky-icky
And we gone do the damn thing
Now what I'm talking bout
We gonna disturb the peace right now
Yeah we ain't doing nothing but chillin
We chillin' and nuttin'
Know what I'm talking bout, so push the button
You know what's happenin', fa shizzle
Yeah bitch, trying to run from this pimpin'
You can't out run the pimpin' bitch, I done told you
