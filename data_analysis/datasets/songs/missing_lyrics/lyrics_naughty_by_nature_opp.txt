Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em!

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for "other," P is for "peoples'," scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten (Uh)
It's five little letters that are missin' here (Uh)
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'(Uh)
It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it (Uh)
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello (Uh)
You get her name and number (Uh)
And then left feelin' real mellow (Uh)
You get home, wait a day (Uh)
She's what you wanna know about, then you call up (Uh)
And it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?! (Uh)
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Oh, that’s why she’s scary)
It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at (Uh)
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co-hittin' that (Uh)
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it (Uh)
But if you don't, here's your membership (Uh)

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the homies!)

Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means somethin' gifted
The first two letters' the same
But the last is somethin' different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word
Rhymin' with "cleanness" or "meanness"
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly (Uh)
I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for "property" (Uh)
Now lady, here comes a kiss (Uh)
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly (Aah)
Have you ever known a brother
Who had another, like, a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast
'Cause he looked just that nice? (Uh)
You looked at him, he looked at you
And you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway! (Uh)
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave
And only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do' (Uh)
Now don't be shy
'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.!) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies!)

A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that (Uh)
Matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that (Uh)
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument (Uh)
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment (Uh)
Bust it! That wasn't the thing (Uh)
It must've been the way she hit the ceiling, 'cause after that she kept on comin' back and catchin' feelings (Uh)
I said: "Let's go, my girl is comin', so you gotta leave." (Uh)
She said: "Oh no, I love you, Treach!"
I said: "Now child, please! You got to leave
Come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!"
I said: "Now look you chooses stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing
You shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell, from the very start!"
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round
Runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep yo' mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Excitin', isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messin' with
Him or her, for sure ain't goin' to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)

Break It Down!
