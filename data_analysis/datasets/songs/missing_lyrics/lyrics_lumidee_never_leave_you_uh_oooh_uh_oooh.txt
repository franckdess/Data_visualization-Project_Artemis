Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh

Honestly
If I tell--
Tell you what--
What you wanna know, love
There ain't another
Don't want no other lover
I'll put nothing above you
I'll kick 'em to the gutter
(Uh oh)
They're trying to shake me
(Uh oh)
They're c-calling me crazy now
(Uh oh)
Look at us lately
(Uh oh)
And tell 'em who's your lady
I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No in and outs
You're here right now

If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh

Now that you're loving back
We're happy, it's a fact
Can't nothing hold us back
We got this in the bag
(Uh oh)
There ain't no maybes
(Uh oh)
No question of your baby now
(Uh oh)
Look at us lately
(Uh oh)
And tell 'em who's your lady
I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No in and outs
You're here right now

If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
Uh oh
