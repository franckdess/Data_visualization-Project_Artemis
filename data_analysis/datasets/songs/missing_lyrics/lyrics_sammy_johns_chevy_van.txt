I gave a girl
A ride in my wagon
She crawled in and took control
She was tired
As her mind was a-draggin'
I said get some sleep and dream of rock and roll

'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

Her young face
Was like that of an angel
Her long legs were tanned and brown
Better keep
Your eyes on the road, son
Better slow this vehicle down

'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

I put her out
In a town that was so small
You could throw a rock from end to end
A dirt road Main Street
She walked off in bare feet
It's a shame I won't be passin' through again

'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

'Cause like a princess she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me
