If you want it
You can have it
That's what you said
But I don't want the things
That you leave behind
Take the pictures
Take the windows
And the walls
Baby, won't you leave me
My peace of mind?

Oh, such a waste of time
Oh, such a waste
I still want you, baby

Heaven, help me (heaven, help me)
Talk to strangers (talk to strangers)
Heaven, help me over you (help me over you)
I can't seem to take these changes
Everything reminds my heart of you

Thought the first time
Was the last time
Would be (forever)
Now I find I'm having to search again
It'll happen
It's gotta happen
Come together
I just wish somebody would tell me when

Oh, such a waste of time
Oh, such a waste
I still want you, baby

Heaven, help me (heaven, help me)
Talk to strangers (talk to strangers)
Heaven, help me over you (help me over you)
I can't seem to take these changes
Everything reminds my heart of you


Heaven, help
Heaven, help
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven, help me
Heaven, help
Heaven, help
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven, help me

Heaven, help me (heaven, help me)
Talk to strangers (talk to strangers)
Heaven, help me over you (help me over you)
I can't seem to take these changes
Everything reminds my heart of
Heaven, help me (heaven, help me)
Talk to strangers (talk to strangers)
Heaven, help me over you (help me over you)
I can't seem to take these changes
Everything reminds my heart of you
(whoooa, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)

Heaven help
Heaven help
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven help me
You're someone else's lady
So sad without you, darling
The gods of love can't help me now
