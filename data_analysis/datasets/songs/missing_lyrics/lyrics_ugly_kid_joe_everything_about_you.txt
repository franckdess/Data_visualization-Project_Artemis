Are you those guys on the beach that hate everything?
Eww! Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?

I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I, I hate the beach and mountains too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too!

And I, hate everything about you
Everything about you

And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too

And I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you

Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again cause I ain't wearing no frown
Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe
I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well that's too bad
Cause I'm havin'
A ball hatin'
Every little thing about you! ha-ha!

Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around

I hate everything abou-u-u-ut
You!
