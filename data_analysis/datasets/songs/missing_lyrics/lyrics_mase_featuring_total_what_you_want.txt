Now Ma$e be the man wanna see you doing good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl, in my eyes you the baddest
The reason why I love you, you don't like me cuz my status
I don't wanna see you with a carriage living average
I wanna do my thing so we be established
And I don't want you rock in them fabrics
Girl, I wanna give you carats 'till you feel you a rabbit
Anything in your path, you want you can have
Walk through the mall, if you like it you can grab
Total it all up and put it on my tab
And then tell your friends all the fun you had

Hey Mama, won't you come here to Papa?
You don't like the way your tata's lookin at Shada?
In a 600 ain't no smokin' cigada
Come over here, I think I see your baby faddah
Here ya go the number to my casa
If you in a rush you call me ma√±ana
Whatever you need girlfriend, I got the whole enchilada
Just the way you like it, Ma$e gon' do you propa'
Girl, I can tell you was meant for me
I can tell by the way you was sent to me
While I'm on tour trying to make them centuries
And they ask who your man, you better mention me
If you don't you know you got a problem
Said you want no beef, girlfriend, don't start none
And it just so happens that I'm seeing cash
Cuz you messed up a lot just trying to be fast
And I ain't gonna ask who smashed the E-Class
Pull up to the crib with the whole front crashed
Now you wanna laugh, good thing that's the past
If you ever lie again, girl, that'll be your last

Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years

Now the more you treat me royal I adore you
That's why I don't mind doing these things for you
You did things for me I wouldn't believe you did
That's why I always want to keep you here
In a year or two, girl, I could see you with my kids
Girl, you make a thug want to get a legal gig
It's only right we spend our lonely nights
Gettin' crazy biz till we awake the kids
Don't get too loud, got respect for you honey
To keep it all real, you come second to my money
And can you be my ghetto love prophecy?
Everybody love you girl, not just me
And I know that you really care a lot for me
Wanna see you happy even if it's not with me (not with me)
Even if it's not with me
