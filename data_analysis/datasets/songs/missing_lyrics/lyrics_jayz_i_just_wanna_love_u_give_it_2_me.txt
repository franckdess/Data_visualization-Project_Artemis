Let's go (Hov')
Uh-huh, Hov'
You, are, not, ready (Hov')
Unstoppable (Dynasty)
Young Hova

I'm a hustler baby (Hov', I'm a hustler)
I just want you to know (Hov', I wanna let you know)
It ain't where I been (it ain't where I been, Hov')
But where I'm bout to go (top of the world! Young Hova, holla)
Now I just wanna love ya! (just wanna love you, Hov')
But be who I am (you know you love me, Hov')
And with all this cash (mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

Yeah, uhh, yeah
When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em? Will I diss 'em? That's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
"And I wish I never met her at all!"
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses (uh-huh)
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion?
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra (okay)
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, save the narrative, you saving it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you saving it for carats
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me (c'mon)

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Said give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

I'm a hustler baby (uh, Hov')
I just want you to know (Hov')
It ain't where I been (Hov')
But where I'm bout to go (ho, ho)
Now I just wanna love ya! (Young Hova)
But be who I am (let me love ya)
And with all this cash (mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Ro-mancin' girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., bubblin' in Dublin
Can't deny me
Why would you want to? You need me
Why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me (Hov'!)

Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
Mama, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Give it to me

Uh, that that that tha uh huh, uhh
