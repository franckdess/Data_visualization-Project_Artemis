Yeah
We're gonna do it like this
Alright, let's go
Give me your love, give me your love
Ugh, what, ugh, Jigga, MC, ha, Clue?
Give me your love, give me your love
Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
Give me your love, give me your love
You almost gotta watch to this, uh-huh, ooh wee!
Give me your love, give me your love
Escape

Oh, your love's so good, I don't wanna let go
And although I should, I can't leave you alone (Ha-ha!)
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all (Sing the song!)

Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby?
Or leaving me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love (Uh-huh)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love (She said)
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love (Uh-huh)
(Get him back)

It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me and you tell me the things
That you know persuades me to relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist at all

Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby?
Or leaving me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

I'm all on the record
Okay, Clue, alright

She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skee-os away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker, when we apart it makes her
Want a piece of paper, scribble down "I hate ya"
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does and ugh!

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Give me your love, give me your love
Give me your love, give me your love
MC, break it down
Ha, ha
X-streak, it's a rap
