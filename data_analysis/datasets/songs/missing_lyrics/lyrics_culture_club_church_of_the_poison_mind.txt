Desolate loving in your eyes
You used an' made my life so sweet
Step out like a God-found child
I saw your eyes across the street
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
In the church of the poison mind
(In the church of the poison mind)
(In the church of the poison)
Watch me clinging to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you could sink it neat
Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine
Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time
Who am I to say that's crazy
Love will make you blind
