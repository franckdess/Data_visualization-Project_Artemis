I see you standing in the alleys and the hallways
(Wait a second)
You're gone now
I run to touch you, but you vanish through the doorway
And, oh, how
Hard it is to live without you
I love everything about you
Now I know you're really gone
But my imagination is so strong
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side
Oh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time
(Wait a second)
Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see
So I keep walking through the alleys and the hallways
Where are you?
I keep remembering the kissing in the doorways
The car, too
How it all comes back to me
The movies every Saturday
The place we used to go to eat
I want so much to have it like it used to be
That I see you coming into view
And your face is telling me that you
Oh, yeah, oh, want to be by my side
Oh, yeah, oh, now it's finally time
(Here it comes again)
Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see
Just a mirage, that's all you are to me
Just a mirage, something that I only see
Just a mirage, that's all you are to me
Just a mirage, something that I only see
