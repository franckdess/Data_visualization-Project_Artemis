Good morning yesterday
You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember
Do you remember
The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember
Do you remember the times of your life (do you remember)
Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
For memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow
Here comes the setting sun
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life
Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life
Of your life
Of your life
Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life
Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life
