I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on baby boo, you gots to get into it
Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood and
Little cutie looking like a student
Long hair with ya big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp pimp fluid
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh girl, that you is

When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow moving
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeaking when we screwing
Now she's yelling, hollering out "Snoop!" and
Hooting, hollering; hollering, hooting
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, thin, black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep grooving, that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in

Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'

You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you in
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue and
