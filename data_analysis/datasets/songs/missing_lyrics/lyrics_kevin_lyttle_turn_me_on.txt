Uh yeah...
Oh yeah!
Is ah big dance hall song in know
Madzart alongside Kevin Lyttle
You know how it is, you know how we go
You know!

For the longest while, we jamming in the party
And you're wining on me
Pushing everything right back on top of me, yeah heh
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind, you're going home
You're going home with me tonight

Let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whine all around me
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on, turn me on

If she think mad man nah go fight
(Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Me done feed her with popcorn and Sprite
Waan come fly 'way like kite

One hand on the ground, your bumper cock sky high
Whining hard on me
Got my python hollerin' for mercy, yeah heh
Then I whisper in her ear so whine harder
And then she said to me, "Boy, just push that thing
Push it harder back on me."

So let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whine all around me
You got me going crazy, you
Turn me on, turn me on

Girl just hug me, hug me, kiss me, squeeze me
Hug me, hug me, kiss and caress me
Hug me, hug me, kiss me, squeeze me
