There was a time in my life
When I opened my eyes and there you were
You were more than a dream
I could reach out and touch you, girl
That was long ago
There are some things
That I guess I'll never know
When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go
When I dream about you
That's when everything's all right
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever
When I dream about you
Girl, you never go away
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love, loving you
How can I get you to see
That I'm falling apart since you've been gone?
I can never be sure
I could ever let go
Your love is much too strong
There are some things
That I guess I'll never know
When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go
When I dream about you
That's when everything's all right
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever
When I dream about you
Girl, you never go away
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love, loving you
There are some things
That I guess I'll never know
When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go
When I dream about you
That's when everything's all right
You're in my arms
Here next to me, forever
When I dream about you
Girl, you never go away
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love, loving you
