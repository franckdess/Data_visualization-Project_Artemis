Konvict (chea)
Akon and Young Jeezy (aye, aye)
Tryin' to take it easy (chea)
Only way to go (you already know what it is, nigga)
And so (aye, let's get it!)

If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor

Tonight I can't sleep, we livin' in Hell
First they give us the work, then they throw us in jail
Road-trip ya, I'm traffickin' the white
Please Lord, don't let me go to jail tonight
Who me? I'm a soul survivor
Ax about 'em in the street, the boy Jeez a rider
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah, life sucks
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks

If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor

Another day, another dollar
Same block, same nigga, same part, same green
I guess we got the same dreams
Or is it the same nightmares?
We let the doves do it for us, we don't cry tears
Real niggas don't budge
When Mel Man got his time he shot birds at the judge
I'm knee-deep in the game
So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the cane
Real talk, look, I'm tellin' you, mayne
If you get jammed up, don't mention my name
Forgive me, Lord, I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggas starvin', they got appetites
And this is e'ryday, it never gets old
Thought I was a juvenile stuck to the G-Code
This ain't a rap song, nigga, this is my life
And if the hood was a battlefield, then I'd earn stripes

If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor

Gotta watch ya e'ry move, 'cause them eyes be on you
Gotta drive real cool when them pies be on you
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous
Them alphabet boys got us under surveillance
Like animals, they lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put 'im on stages
I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
No nuts, no glory
My biography, you damn right, the true story
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die

'Cause if you lookin' for me
You can find me on the block, disobeyin' the law
Real G, thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my drawers
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now, aye

If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor
