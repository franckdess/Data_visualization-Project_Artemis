Stop the track, lemme state facts
I told you, gimme a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they say that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benjis, I can't spend it
How you gon' be talkin' shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper - the one that they call the Queen
Every radio 'round the world know me 'cause that's where I be (first!)

When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six-pack in the cooler
Gettin' money, diva's gettin' money
If you ain't gettin' money, then you ain't got nothin' fo' me
Tell me somethin', (Tell me somethin')
Where yo boss at (Where yo' boss at?)
Where my ladies up in here that like to talk back? (That like to talk back)
I wanna see her (I wanna see her)
I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)
What you say? (Not to me)
She ain't no diva (She ain't no diva)...

Since 15 in my stilettos, been struttin' in this game
"What's yo age?" was the question they ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin' paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, "Where that money?")
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same;
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane

I'm a, I'm a-a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a diva
I'm a, I'm a a diva (hey), I'm a, I'm a a di...

This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money)
