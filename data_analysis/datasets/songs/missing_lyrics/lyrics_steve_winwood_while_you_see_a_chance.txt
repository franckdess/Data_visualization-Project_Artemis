Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?
When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you
While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you
Dont you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And dont you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way
When theres no one left to leave you
Even you dont quite believe you
Thats when nothing can deceive you
While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you
Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?
And that old gray wind is blowing
And theres nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going
While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
