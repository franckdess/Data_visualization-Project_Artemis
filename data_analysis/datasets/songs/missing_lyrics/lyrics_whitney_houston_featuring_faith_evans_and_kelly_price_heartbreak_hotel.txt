You said you'd be here by 9
Instead, you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit, tryin' not to cry
Askin' myself why you do this to me

Since you're not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me

Now I see, that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along and made a fool of me baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me, baby how could you do it to me

Since you're not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me
You didn't have to do it to me baby

Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me
I wanted your love
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? Can't take what you did to me

I ain't going to take it, I ain't going to take it no more
I ain't going to take it, boy
I ain't going to take it no more
Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
