Sweet cream ladies, forward march
The world owes you a living
Sweet cream ladies, do your part
Think of what you're giving
To the lost and lonely people of the night
Out of need, they seek direction for their life
They will love you in the darkness
Take advantage of your starkness
And refuse to recognize you in the light
Sweet cream ladies, forward march
Think what you're providing
Sweet cream ladies, show your starch
What's the use of hiding?
Tell the socialites to look the other way
It's instinctive stimulation you convey
It's a necessary function
Meant for those without compunction
Who get tired of vanilla every day
Sweet cream ladies forward march
Puritans ignore them
Sweet cream ladies do their part
Sweet cream men adore them
Let them satisfy the ego of the male
Let them fabricate success to those who fail
And should penalties pursue them
When there's really credit due them
They might keep a simple fellow out of jail!
Sweet cream ladies, forward march. O-o-o?
