I don't love her
I tried to tell myself
But you can see it in my eyes
So don't deny
I can't fool no one else
The truth is in the tears I cry
'Cause...

If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way?
Why does she stay on my mind?
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad?
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love
I told her I'd never fall in love
But now I know better

How does it feel
I can't describe this feeling
That came when I saw her last night
She got to me
I'll let you know the reason
I saw her with another guy
So...

If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way?
Why does she stay on my mind?
And if it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad?
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love

Maybe she'll take me back
(Hey, girl, he's begging)
I made a big mistake
(Won't you forgive him, girl)
Now I can feel it
(He's never felt before)
I really love her
(You love her?!?! What?!?!)

It took my heart
To shatter in a thousand pieces
Before I'd ever drop my pride
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Losing love worrying about my image
Really helped me realize

If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way?
(Why does it hurt so bad?)
Why does she stay on my mind?
(On my mind all the time)
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad?
(If it isn't love)
Make me feel so sad inside
(If it isn't love)
If it isn't love
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way?
Why does she stay on my mind?
(She stays on my mind, mind, mind)
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad?
(Why does it hurt so bad?)
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love
(If it isn't love)
Why do I feel this way?
(If it isn't love)
Why does she stay on my mind?
(If it isn't love)
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad?
(If it isn't love)
Make me feel so sad inside
(If it isn't, I can't describe this feeling that I feel for her)
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way?
Why does she stay on my mind?
(Stay on my mind)
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad?
Make me feel so sad inside

If it isn't love
If it isn't love
