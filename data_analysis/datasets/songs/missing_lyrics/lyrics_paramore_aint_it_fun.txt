I don't mind
Letting you down easy but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond, no more
You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
Ooh ooh, uh uh
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?

Ain't it fun, living in the real world?
Ain't it good, being all alone?

Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble

So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
Ooh ooh, uh uh
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you
Oh oh, uh uh

Ain't it fun, living in the real world?
Ain't it good, being all alone?

(Oh) Ain't it good to be on your own?
(Oh) Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one?
(Ah) Ain't it good to be on your own?
(Ah) Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one?

Ain't it fun, living in the real world?

Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun, ain't it fun?
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun, ain't it fun, ain't it fun?

Ain't it fun, living in the real world?
Ain't it good, ain't it good, being all alone?
Ain't it fun, living in the real world?
'Cause the world don't orbit around you
Ain't it good, ain't it good, being all alone?
