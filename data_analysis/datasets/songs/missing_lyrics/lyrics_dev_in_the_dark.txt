On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark

Tell me baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands, do what they want?
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance, dance, dancing in the dark

Dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark

Put your work on me
Open my body up and do some surgery
Now that you got me up, I wanna taste it, taste it
And see those pocket aces

I wanna see who you are, I got a sex drive just push to start
Got a sex drive just push to start, push push push push to start
Push push push push to start
Got a sex drive just push to start

On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
Dance, dance, dancing in the dark

Dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark

I love to flirt to see, I'm only talking to you
If you wanna surf my seas, now that you got me boy
You know you better spice it, flavor it
Ge-ge-get it right, savor it

I wanna see who you are, I got a sex drive just push to start
Got a sex drive just push to start, push push push push to start
Push push push push to start
Got a sex drive just push to start

On my waist, through my hair
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are
All alone dancing in the dark

Tell me baby, if it's wrong
To let my hands, do what they want?
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance, dance, dancing in the dark

Tell me baby, if its wrong
Dancing in the dark
To let my hands
Do what they want

It's the Cataracs, dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
