Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long, ooh!
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long (All night long)
A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long, mmm yeah
If you are going my way (You are going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (All night long)

There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eyes
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (All night long, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway (Life is a highway)
I want to ride it all night long (Wooh, yeah)
If you're going my way (Going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (Ooh, yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah)
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, I want to ride it all night long, babe)
If you're going my way (You going my way)
I want to drive it all night long
