Friday night you and your boys went out to eat, oh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three (Yes you did)
If six of y'all went out, uh
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah, ah

I'll pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (Yes, I am)
The phone rings, and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh

I've been through all of this before
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
Don't think about it, don't think about it
That I would stand around and take some more?
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change
Things are gon' change, baby
'Cause I don't wanna be a fool anymore
You don't stand no chance, boy
That's why you have to leave
Said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't turn around to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that? (Tell me, oh)
See, I'm movin' on
And I refuse to turn back (Back, back, yeah)
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me, ohh

It's not right, but it's okay
Sho 'nuff okay, ha
I'm gonna make it anyway
Make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Pack your bags, get out and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
Don't you dare... back to me, boy
It's not right, but it's okay
It's not right, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm gonna... I'm gonna... ahh
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
Close the door, and leave your keys
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, oh
It's not right, but it's okay
It's not right, it's okay, baby
I'm gonna make it anyway
I can pay my own rent
Pack your bags, up and leave
Pay my light bill, take care of my babies
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
It's not right, but it's okay
Oh, lord
Oh-oh-oh, ooh

Get up and leave
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
