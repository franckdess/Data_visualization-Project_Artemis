Do you know what that mean, mayne?
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
Do you know what that mean?
She got her own house, she got her own car
Two jobs, work hard, you a bad broad
If you ain't on, sit down, if you ain't on, sit down
If you ain't on, sit down, if you ain't on, sit down

I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
Do you know what that mean?
Baby Phat, just relax, front your own flat screen
Back rub, cook, clean and don't make her make a scene
When you call her on her cellular, she tell you she don't need
Not a goddamn thang, you a hot damn thang
If you think you finna get her with a goddamn chain
You insane, boy you better get some goddamn change
She a fool, been to school, even walked across the stage
And she say, "I love Webbie from his looks to his ways"
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own, I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standin waitin for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

If you ain't on, sit down, if you ain't on, sit down
If you ain't on, sit down, if you ain't on, sit down

She a dome dime diva, gutta like Keisha
Work that meter, she a good freaker
She stay on her shit, she got her own shit
She don't neva trip, all she want is that dick
She bouncy, flossy, keep them hoes off me
Gutta, lil slang, man I love when she talkin
A independent chick, do you know what that mean?
She cook, she clean, never smell like onion rings
22's on her whip, oh she do it large (she do it large)
When she break a nigga off, got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil chick, a fly lil chick
Hit me on my phone, she like to buy that dick
Got her stunna shades on, lookin like something
Stallion, hair long, she a nice something
Like to go to the mall every day for a outfit
Hair did, nails did, independent what she call it

Boosie Badazz
She got her own house, drive her own whip
Range Rover all white like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile, smell real good
Only time she need a man for that good joog
They buy the bar too, they superstars too
They be like, "You ain't got no money? Take yo broke tail home"
In Baby Phat they on, they clothes match they phone
They be like "Yeah!" when they song come on
Leave the club kinda early cause they gotta go to work
I mess with supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet, please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind who spoil me
Gucci hat, Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick, yessir!
Tryna get next to her, gotta be ya self, mayne
Cause she got her own money, she don't need no help, mayne
Boosie!
