Who's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and...?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why...

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?


(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching me?)
Well, is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (Who?!) - the IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Who's watching?)

(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I can't enjoy my tea
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Can I have my privacy?
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Who's watching me?
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Stop playing tricks on me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Why you don't let me be?
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
