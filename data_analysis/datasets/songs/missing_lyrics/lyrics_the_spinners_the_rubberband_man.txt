Hand me down my walkin' cane
Hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late
'Cause we ain't got time to chat
You and me, we're goin' out
To catch the latest sound
Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Oh, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does
Seems to come out right

Once I went to hear him play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized
By the sound these cats put down
When I saw this short, fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the man got down
When it finally reached his nose

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Got that rubber band, uh
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose

(Du du du du du du du du)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Du du du du du du du du)
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
(Du du du du du du du du)
Where in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord
(Du du du du du)
Lord, help him get away

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Rubberband man, rubberband man, uh
(Du du du du du du du du)
Du du du du
(Du du du du du du du du)
Watch him, keep movin', just movin'
Got em groovin' on the corner, it's burnin' up, y'all
(Du du du du du du du du)
Ohooohooohhh

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound

You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Rubberband man's a doosin'
Move so quick, uh, he make me lose it
(Du du du du du du du du)
And then he stopped to show down
He wiggle it up, he wiggle it down, uh
(Du du du du du du du du)
Got speed to move it
Get rubberband off the ground, uh
(Du du du du du du du du)
He lifted it well high
In the sky, y'all
And then he
Du du du du du
Oh, get with it, y'all

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Turn it up, turn it up
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, uh
Rubberband man, rubberband man, uh

How much of this stuff do he think we can stand, uh, huh?
(Du du du du du du du du)
So much rhythm, grace, and debonair for one man, Lord
(Du du du du du du du du)
And then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe
Slip it through his knee, got the feeling in his head, y'all
(Du du du du du)
Aw, come on, baby

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself (won't you prepare yourself, hear me) for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound (never heard a sound)
Like the rubberband man (Aw, he's the man)
You're bound to lose control (and he likes to jam)
When the rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband man starts to jam
Moving up and down cross the land
Got the people all in his wake
Everything probably seems outta place

Just move it, just move it
(Du du du du du du du du)
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man
Just move it, just move it

You're bound to lose control (take a seat and move)
When the rubberband starts to jam

Just groovin' up loudly
Gotta move, I gotta groove

When the rubberband starts to jam
