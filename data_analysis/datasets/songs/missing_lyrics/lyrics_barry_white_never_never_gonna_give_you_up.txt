Hey, that's Barry White!
An obsession, a burning desire
Barry, you want some chicken?
The undeniable passion
Aw, you tryin' all that sexy stuff!
The love, of someone or some thing
Y'know you want some chicken?

In fact, I was a baddest dribbler in the whole world
Then one day, his mother bought him a basketball
And I love that basketball! I took that basketball everywhere I went!
You know what? That basketball was like a basketball to me!

In fact, better looking than my brother Tony
Didn't owe me money, and didn't piss in a bed!
And after the game, I always took a shower wit' my basketball
Every now and then, the basketball gonna pinch my butt
But I didn't mind, cause my and my basketball had good, clean fun
See I am a victim of a Basketball Jones, I'll take my basketball everywhere
I'll even put my basketball under the pillow
Maybe that's why you couldn't sleep at night
