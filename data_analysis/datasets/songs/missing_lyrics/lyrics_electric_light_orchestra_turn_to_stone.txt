The city streets are empty now
(The lights don't shine no more)
And so the songs are way down low
(Turning, turning, turning)
A sound that flows into my mind
(The echoes of the daylight)
Of everything that is alive
(In my blue world)

I turn to stone
When you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone
When you comin' home?
I can't go on

The dying embers of the night
(A fire that slowly fades till dawn)
Still glow upon the wall so bright
(Turning, turning, turning)
The tired streets that hide away
(From here to everywhere they go)
Roll past my door into the day
In my blue world

I turn to stone
When you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone
When you comin' home?
I can't go on
Turn to stone
When you are gone
I turn to stone

(Yes, I'm turnin' to stone)
('Cause you ain't comin' home)
(Why ain't you comin' home)
(If I'm turnin' to stone)
(You've been gone for so long)
(And I can't carry on)
(Yes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin')
(I'm turnin' to stone)

The dancing shadows on the wall
(The two step in the hall)
Are all I've seen since you've been gone
(Turning, turning, turning)
Through all I sit here and I wait
(I turn to stone, I turn to stone)
You will return again someday
To my blue world

I turn to stone
When you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone
When you comin' home?
I can't go on
Turn to stone
When you are gone
I turn to stone

I turn to stone
When you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone
When you comin' home?
I can't go on
Turn to stone
When You Are Gone
I Turn To Stone
