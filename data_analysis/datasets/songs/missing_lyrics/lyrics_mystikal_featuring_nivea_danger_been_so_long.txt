You know what time it is, nigga
And you know who the fuck this is
Danger, danger; get on the floor
The nigga right chea; sing it

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keeping you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Taking they shirt off, showing they tattoos
Screaming and hollering and all
Got the gift to come up with it
Put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on
Sharp like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad like that student in the principal office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damnedest lyrical marvel you don't come across often
So watch yourself
Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know
Go head though, bounce them titties
Shake that ass, drop that pussy but stay in line ho
Fuck I can't, cause you can can
Cocked up, head down, pussy popping on a handstand
Leave that pussy smoking
If you gon' do something then bend over, and bust that pussy open

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please
Show me
What it is that you want to see

My fucking concert line around the corner
Parking cars, niggas looking for they bitch, nothing on her
You looking good momma; why, pssh what's up homie
Sirens, limousines, and the club owner ya bitch you
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch cause it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough
I'm backstage bouncing, adrenaline building up
The pussy cutter, did I stutter
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme-seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit then, bitch that's what it is

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

Danger, talking bout
Danger, motherfucker look
Get on the flo'
The nigga right chea
Danger, motherfucker, watch your back
Danger, look look
Nigga what, look look
Get on the flo'
The nigga right chea, get 'em up

Danger, talking bout
Danger, motherfucker look
Get on the flo'
The nigga right chea
Danger, motherfucker, watch your back
Danger, look look
Nigga what, look look
Get on the flo'
The nigga right chea, get 'em up

I wanna see these fake rappers get off the mic
Gimme my room, you grabbed my space
Look out you all in my life, watch out man
I'm ripping a solo, I jump in the show, the rest are no more
Threw lyrical bolos, head butts and rhyme elbows
Get off me; tip-toe, wild slow, wild softly
Hurry up, you might not be able to do that shortly
Ain't trying to forget the chea
The whole crowd screaming out danger, danger

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

Danger
Danger
Get on the floor
The nigga right here
