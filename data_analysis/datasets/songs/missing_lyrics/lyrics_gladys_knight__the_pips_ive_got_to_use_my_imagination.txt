I've really got to use
My imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on (Keep on keepin' on)
Got to make the best of (Best of, best of)
A bad situation (Bad situation)
Ever since that day (Ever since that day)
I woke up and found
That you were gone (Gone, gone)
Darkness all around me
Blockin' out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin' to anyone
Emptiness has found me
And it just won't let me go
I go right on livin'
But why, I just don't know (You're too strong, got to keep on keepin' on)
Yes, I am
(You're too strong, got to keep on keepin' on)
Staring down reality
Don't do me no good
Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood (Too well understood)
Such a sad, sad season (Sad, sad season)
When a good love dies (When a good love dies)
Not a day goes by (Not a day goes by)
When I don't realize (Realize)
Ooh, ooh, oh, I've really got to use (I've got to use)
My imagination (I've got to use)
To think of good reasons (I've got to use)
To keep on keepin' on (I've got to use)
I've got to make the best of (Best of, best of)
A bad situation (Bad situation)
Ever since that day (Ever since that day)
I woke up and found out
That you were gone (You're too strong, got to keep on keepin' on)
I've really got to use (I've got to use)
A good imagination (I've got to use)
To think of good reasons (I've got to use)
To keep on pushin' on (I've got to use)
I said I've got to make the best of (Best of, best of)
A bad situation (Bad situation)
Ever since that day (Ever since that day)
I woke up and found out
That you were gone (You're too strong, got to keep on keepin' on)
Oh, I've really got to use (I've got to use)
A good imagination (I've got to use)
Got to think of good reasons (I've got to use)
To keep on keepin' on (I've got to use)
I've got to make the best of
