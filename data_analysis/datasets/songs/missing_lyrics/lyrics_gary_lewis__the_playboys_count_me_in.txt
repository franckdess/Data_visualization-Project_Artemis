If you need someone to count on
Count me in
Someone you can rely on
Through thick and thin
When you start to count
The ones that you might ever doubt
If you think of counting me
Count me out
When you count the ones that want you
Count me, too
And if I'm not first on your list
Count me blue
Just be sure you count on me
And when the countings through
Count me madly in love with you
If you need someone to count on
When you're down
And all your other friends you've lost
Count me found
Just be sure you count on me
When you're down and out
Count me in through thick and thin
Or it don't count
When you count the ones that want you
Count me, too
And if I'm not first on your list
Count me blue
Just be sure you count on me
And when the countings through
Count me madly in love with you
