I don't wanna see you ever sad
And everything that I've got you can have
When it's all too much
You need some human touch
To see that it's really not so bad
Did you call on every saint you know
But still, you feel like you're on your own
Can you see through your tears
I will always be here
And you're not out there all alone
Chorus
Hold on, till you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me
Hold on, everything's gonna be alright
Just hold on to me tonight
Anything that hurts you, hurts me too
IÂ´m not gonna let your world turn blue
Will you take my hand
And feel how close I am
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you
Chorus
Hold on, till you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me
Hold on, everything's gonna be alright
Just hold on to me tonight
I know the world
Can drive you to your knees
But when you need to cry, baby
Cry to me
Chorus
Hold on, till you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me
Hold on, everything's gonna be alright
Just hold on to me tonight
