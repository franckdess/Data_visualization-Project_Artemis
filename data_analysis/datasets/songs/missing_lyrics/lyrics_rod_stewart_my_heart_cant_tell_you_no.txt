Em said he a god, Miley out here twerking
I walked in Def Jam, wasn't no black folks working
Soul is Robin Thicke, Adele's that too
Justin Timberlake is what Usher's supposed to do
But that's Elvis, Elvis, just like Elvis
We won't buy no music and everybody is selfish
Elvis, Elvis, just like Elvis
We won't buy no music and everybody is selfish
Elvis, Elvis, just like Elvis
Our freedom, now our music, I'm asking God to help us
Elvis, Elvis, just like Elvis

Lord don't take my heart, Lord don't take my soul
Lord don't let them take Hip-Hop like they took Rock and Roll
Please, Apple's just a store, we rotten to the core
Ay what you rapping for if you don't look like Macklemore?
They don't need you, they don't need me, don't see you on MTV
Michael Jackson turned back black and then they killed him and dropped his CD
Something's missing, something's missing and you can't tell me different
White folks own Black Entertainment Television
That's why...

Dear Lord, I hope we make it back
They stole our culture and I don't know how to take it back
They are slowly infiltrating, Lord, them planning they attack
They call you 'nigga' to your face and then they dare you to say it back
Ay, white boy let's make a track, white boy let's make a track
Get them 8-0-8s and tats, bet you think that make it black
Ay, white girl let's make a track, white girl let's make a track
Get them ass shots, twerking hard, I bet you think it's black
Yeah these black gods, they grab guitars and guess what
Now FL got John Mayer, don't need that Cody Chestnutt
Or that Lenny Kravitz or Jimmy Hendrix
Robin Thicke is Eddie Kendricks

He wanna go pop so he can get off of the block
He wanna go pop so he can get off of the block
She wanna make it pop so she can make that money drop
Make that money drop but the pain won't stop
Alright, alright, alright, I see the big picture
Going pop, you get a little richer
'Cause Little Richie can't be Nirvana
Be your Rihanna, can't be Madonna
Got Rod Stewart in the Hall of Fame
Whitney Houston don't have a thing
Michael Jordan don't own his name
Don't own his name, it don't mean a thing
