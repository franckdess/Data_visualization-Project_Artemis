When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When you're close I can feel the power
When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now
It's something that I know so well

Hold me closer and every minute
Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher
And feel the fire of the power of love

Did you know that your feelings show
You thought your love was locked up inside
But when your senses start to overload
Love is something you should never hide

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love
Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that we can't deny
Is the power of love

So close your eyes and you can feel it
Coming straight from above, it's the power of love
You can't deny it, so don't even try it
Let the feeling sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love
Tell everyone you see
How much better the world could be
For them and for you, for me
With the power of love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
My-my-my-my-my-my
You've got to feel the power
Yeah, yeah

So listen up, and you will hear it
A symphony from above, it's the power of love
So glad we've found it, now there's no way around it
Just let the feeling sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love
Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that you can't deny
Is the power of love

When we walk down the street
We don't care who we see or who we meet
Don't need to run, don't need to hide
'Cause we've got something burning inside, yeah
We've got love, love power
It's the greatest power of them all, doo-ooh-ooh
We've got love, love power
And together, we can't fall, sing it with me
We've got love (Love) power (Power)
It's the greatest power of them all
Oh, we've got love (Love) and all of the power (Power)
And together we can't fall, and all the good
(We've got love) Ooh, we've got love (Power), yes, we do
(It's the greatest power of them all, hey hey)
(We've got love) Love-love-love (Power)
(And together, we can't fall) We'll never fall if we've got
(We've got love) If we've got love (And all of the power)
(It's the greatest power of them all, hey hey)
(We've got love) Tell the world we got love (Power) tell the people about it
(And together, we can't fall) And it's all because we've got
We've got love (Love) power (Power)
Oh, it's the greatest power of them all, and if you believe me
We've got more love (Love) more of the power (Power)
And together we can't fall, I know, can't fall
We can't fall (Love) when there's a love power (Power)
'Cause it's the greatest power of them all
