Am I the only one who's never had fun
In the twelve years we've gone steady?
Put down the parasol, that isn't you at all
When the whole thing crumbles I won't be there
I'm going on a big vacation
'Cause I deserve some fun
Got the top down swimming in the ocean
I got the sunblock on
And you feel so elite with me below your feet
And always at the ready
I'm going on a big vacation
I can't escape the sun
Got the top down swimming in the ocean
And where the Go-Go's trod
I'm there with a cheap beach blanket
The kind you don't take home
No cheap wine, I've got a jug of lancers
I got the sunblock on
Soon the walls around you break
And there's no one to make you feel safe
And all the problems that you fake
I won't be there
I'm going on a big vacation
'Cause I deserve some fun
Got the top down swimming in the ocean
And Flock Of Seagulls on
"I Ran" and a "Photograph Of You"
That singer's haircut's sad
I think I found the perfect occupation
I got the sunblock on
I'm going on a big vacation
And I will not come home
My new address is sitting by the ocean
I can't be reached by phone
When I'm gone you can climb the social ladder
Respectable at last
Turn your back on all the things that matter
I've got the sunblock on, on, on, on
On, on, on
