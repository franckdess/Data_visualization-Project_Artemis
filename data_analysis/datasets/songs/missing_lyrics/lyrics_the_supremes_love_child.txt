(Tenement slum
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah)
You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes, I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me
Started my life in an old, cold, rundown
Tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name
Ah, this love we're contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating

Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child (Scorned by) society
Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, different from the rest
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me
Ah, don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child)
But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
You, you, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
You (Just a little bit longer, love child)
You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
