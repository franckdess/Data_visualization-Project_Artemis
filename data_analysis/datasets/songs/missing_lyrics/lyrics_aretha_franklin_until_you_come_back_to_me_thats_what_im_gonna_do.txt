Though you don’t call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I want to tell you, baby
Changes I’ve been going through
Missing you, listen you

'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
I’m going to swallow my pride (my pride)
I’m going to beg you to please, baby please see me (baby won't you see me?)
I’m going to walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true
All for you baby

'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea (hear my plea)
I’ve got to make you see (make you see)
That our love is dying (our love is dying)

Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must, somehow I must, how I must explain
I’m going to rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I’m going to camp by your steps
Until I get through to you (uuuh)
I’ve got to change your view, baby

'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

I’m going to rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby, I’m gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your, tap on your (tap on)
Tap on your , tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I’m going to rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby
