Mmmm L.A
Proved too much for the man
(Too much for the man he couldn't make it)
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know
(He said he's goin)
He said he's goin' back to find
(Goin back to find)
Ooh ooh ooh what's left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago

He's leaving (leavin)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leavin on a midnight train)
Said he's goin' back (Goin back to find)
To a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
Oh yes he is
And I'll be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
(That world is his, his and hers alone)

He kept dreamin' (Dreamin)
Ooh that someday he'd be a star
(A superstar but he didn't get far)
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true
(Dreams don't always come true)
Oh no! ah ah (uh uh, no, uh uh)
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh yes he did

He said he would
Oh oh he's leavin (leavin)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train )
Said he's goin' back to find (Goin back to find)
Oh a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I'm gonna be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world (Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)
Ooh, he's leaving
(Leaving)
On the midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Said he's going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh, a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I've got to be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

For love, gonna board the midnight train to ride
For love, gonna board, gotta board the midnight train to go
For love, gonna board, uh huh, the midnight train to go
My world, his world, our world, mine and his alone
My world, his world, our world, mine and his alone
I got to go
I got to go
I got to go, hey
I got to go
I got to go
My world, his world, my man, his girl
I got to go
I got to go, oh
I got to go
My world, his world, our world, his girl
