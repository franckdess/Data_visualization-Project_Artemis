Baby, it seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

Who'd-a thought we could be lovers?
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy, baby, I get obsessed

She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract
A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

You know it, baby, baby
We come together
We come together

Baby, ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long?
You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cause we're perfectly matched

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract
A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

Two steps forward, two steps back
Two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites, opposites attract
It ain't fiction, you know it's a fact
It's a fact
We come together 'cause opposites, opposites
Two steps forward, two steps back
A two steps back
Opposites attract
We go together
We go together
Two steps forward, two steps back
A two steps back
