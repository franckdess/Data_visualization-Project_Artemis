There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Ooooh!

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Ooooh!

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Yeeaahhh!

Ooooh!

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me

Come on the rising wind
We're going up around the bend
Yeeaahhh!
