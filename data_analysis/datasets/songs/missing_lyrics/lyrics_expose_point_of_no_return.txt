Common love
Seems just like a dream
It's a mystery to me
Fills me within
When we're together
Oh, baby
Can't you see?
I
I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I will be in full reaction
I wanna take you in my arms
You're taking me
To the point of no return
Uh, uh, uh
You're taking me
To the point of no return
Uh, uh, uh
It's so long
Life of denial
The love you gave to me
And when you smile
It warms my heart in me
Oh, baby
Can't you see?
I
I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
Oh, baby
I will be in full reaction
I wanna to take you in my arms
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(To the point of no return)
Oh, oh, oh
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh

I wanna be with you, baby
(Ooh, wah, ooh, wah)
I'm gonna be by your side
(By your side)
I wanna be with you, baby
(Ooh, wah, ooh, wah)
I'm gonna love you every night
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, oh, oh
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(Come on and take me to the point)
(Come on and take me to the point)
Oh, oh, oh
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(No holding back)
(No holding back)
Oh, oh, oh
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(Hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh
You're taking me
To the point of no return
(Oh, baby)
