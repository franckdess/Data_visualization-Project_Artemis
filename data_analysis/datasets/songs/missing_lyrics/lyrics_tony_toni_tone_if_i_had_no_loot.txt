If the shoe fits
I want you to wear it and wear it good

Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me, my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends, and that's what they say
Constantly taking from me every day
You say...

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all
