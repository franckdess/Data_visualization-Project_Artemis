I wanna freak you

Every time I close my eyes
I wake up feeling so horny
I can't get you outta my mind
Sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freek'n you is all I need

Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my mind
You got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you

What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you

Oooh, I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last cause I'm a freak
Turned on by everything you say
I'm turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you

Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my mind
You got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you

What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you
What must I say
What must I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you

Freek out and freek me up and down
