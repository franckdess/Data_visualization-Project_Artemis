(Jerusalem, Sunday)

Good Caiaphas, the council waits for you
The Pharisees and priests are here for you

Ah, gentlemen, you know why we are here
We've not much time and quite a problem here

Hosanna! Superstar!

Listen to that howling mob of blockheads in the street!
A trick or two with lepers and the whole town's on its feet

He is dangerous

Jesus Christ, Superstar
Tell us that you're who we say you are

He is dangerous

The man is in town right now to whip up some support

A rabble rousing mission that I think we must abort

He is dangerous

Jesus Christ, Superstar!

He is dangerous

Look Caiaphas, they're outside our yard

Quick, Caiaphas, go call the Roman guard

No, wait - we need a more permanent solution to our problem

What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth
Miracle wonderman, hero of fools?

No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans

One thing I'll say for him: Jesus is cool

We dare not leave him to his own devices
His half-witted fans will get out of control

But how can we stop him? His glamour increases
By leaps every minute; he's top of the poll

I see bad things arising: the crowd crown him king
Which the Romans would ban
I see blood and destruction, our elimination
Because of one man
Blood and destruction because of one man

Because, because, because of one man

Our elimination because of one man

Because, because, because of one
Cause of one, cause of one man

What then to do about this Jesusmania?

How do we deal with the carpenter king?

Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his Baptism thing?

Fools! You have no perception!
The stakes we are gambling are frightenly high!
We must crush him completely
So like John before him, this Jesus must die
For the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die

Must die, must die, this Jesus must die

So like John before him, this Jesus must die

Must die, must die, this Jesus must
Jesus must, Jesus must die
