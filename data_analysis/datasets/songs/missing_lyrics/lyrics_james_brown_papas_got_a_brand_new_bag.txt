Come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip
About that new breed thing

He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag

Come here, mama
And dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy
But his line is pretty clean

He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag

He's doing The Jerk
He's doing The Fly
Don't play him cheap
'Cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing The Monkey, The Mashed Potatoes
Jump back Jack, see you later, alligator

Come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now
But I can dig the new breed thing

He ain't no drag
He's got a brand new bag

Well, Papa, you're doing The Jerk
Papa, he's doing The Jerk
You're doing The Twist, just like this
He's doing The Fly every day and every night
The thing, like The Boomerang

Hey!
Come on, hey hey!
Come on, hey hey!
Said you're uptight, you're out of sight
Come on, see what you know
Come on, see what you know
