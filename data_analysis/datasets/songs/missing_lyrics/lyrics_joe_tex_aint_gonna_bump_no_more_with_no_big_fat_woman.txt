That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night
That girl I'm gonna make her mine
If it takes all night
Good evening sweet darling
May I ask your name
You seem to be lonely
Well don't worry I'm feeling the same
Oh, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet
At a time like this
Oh it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
You're something that
I just can't miss
It's been a long time sweet darling
Since love has come my way
But I'm trying so hard
To find the right words to say
Oh, it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
That we should meet
At a time like this
Oh it's a groovy situation
A splendid combination
You're something that
I just can't miss
