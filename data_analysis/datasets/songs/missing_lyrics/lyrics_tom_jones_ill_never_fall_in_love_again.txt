I've been in love so many times
Thought I knew the score
But now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take anymore
And it looks like
I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it
Fall in love again
All those things I heard about you
I thought they were only lies
But when I caught you in his arms
I just broke down and cried
And it looks like
I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it, I mean it
Fall in love again
I gave my heart so easily
I cast aside my pride
But when you fell for someone else, baby
I broke up all inside
And it looks like
I'm never gonna fall in love again
That's why I'm a-singin' it
Fall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me
Fall in love again
