I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!
I can't get no (x3)
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction (x3)
I can't get no
