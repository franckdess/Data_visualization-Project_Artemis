Yeah, uh!
Get up, now!
Ow!
Knock out this!
Super highways, coast to coast
Easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload
Just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel
When there's no destination - that's too far
And somewhere on the way
You might find out who you are
Living in America - eye to eye, station to station
Living in America - hand to hand, across the nation
Living in America - got to have a celebration
Rock my soul
Smokestack, fatback
Many miles of railroad track
All night radio, keep on runnin'
Through your rock 'n' roll soul
All night diners keep you awake
Hey, on black coffee and a hard roll
You might have to walk the fine line
You might take the hard line
But everybody's working overtime
Living in America
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand to hand, across the nation
Living in America
Got to have a celebration
I live in America, help me out
But I live in America
Wait a minute
You might not be looking for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names
Like New Orleans (New Orleans)
Detroit City (Detroit City), Dallas (Dallas)
Pittsburg P.A. (Pittsburg P.A.)
New York City (New York City)
Kansas City (Kansas City)
Atlanta (Atlanta), Chicago and L.A
Living in America
Ht me
Living in America
Yeah
I walk in and out
Living in America
I live in America
State lines
Gonna make the prime that
I live in America
Hey
I know what it means, I
Living in America
Eddie Murphy, eat your heart out
Living in America
Hit me, I said now, eye to eye
Station to station
Living in America
So nice, with your bare self
Living in America
I feel good!
