Eeee
This town is run by martial law
And Warren G are the marshall
So, Warren G, just pick up yourself everytime
'Cause you don't know I say you rule!

(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
To more than many murders
LA's a war fields
We keep making war shields
Streets keep souls
Young brothers lose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it they'll put you in a twist
And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
They do crime and  attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

They tryin' to stick with some shit that I did not do
You know who
The boys in blue
There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
My profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats
Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day
A hommies a hommie
A fake is a snake
Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was)

A lick four shot for da Jamaican posse
