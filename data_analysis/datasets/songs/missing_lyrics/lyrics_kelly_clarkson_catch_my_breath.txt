I don't want to be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life

Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadow boxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now

Addicted to the love I've found
Heavy heart now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time

Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I won't spend the rest of my life

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now

You help me see the beauty in everything

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told whatâ€™s supposed to be right

(Catch my breath) Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now
It's all so simple now

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

(Catch my breath) Catch my breath
No one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
(C-c-c-c-c-catch my breath) Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down
It's all so simple now
