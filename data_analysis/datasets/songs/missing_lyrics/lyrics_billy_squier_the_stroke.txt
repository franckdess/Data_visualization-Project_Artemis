Now everybody
Have you heard?
If you're in the game
Then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm
Don't take no style
Got a thirst for killing
Grab your vial

You put your right hand out
Give a firm handshake
Talk to me
About the one big break
Spread the ear pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and stroke me, stroke me

Stroke me, stroke me
Could be a winner, boy, you move quite well
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
You got your number down
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out
Keep it all in place
Work your way
Right into my case
First you try to bed me
You make my backbone slide
But when you find you bled me
Step on by
Keep on

Stroke me, stroke me
Give me the business all night long
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
You're so together, boy
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

Better listen now
Said it ain't no joke
Let your conscience fail you
Just do the stroke
Don't you take no chances
Keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances
You can't stop, you just

Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Do it
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Keep on
Stroke me, stroke me
Yeah, you're gonna
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
