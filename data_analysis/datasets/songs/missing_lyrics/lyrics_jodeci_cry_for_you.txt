Without you, baby
I feel worthless
I'm living on the edge

It's been an hour since you've been gone
And that's too long, so come back home
I can't live without you
So I'll cry for you
Do anything that I can
To feel that touch from your hand
Sorry that I want you
Lady, what do I do?
You know...

You're everything I knew
Ooh yeah
Do what you want me to
I would do anything
Get on my knees for you
Ooh, baby
What else is there to do?
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll cry

Lady, I will cry for you tonight, tonight
(Yeah)
Lady, I will cry for you tonight, tonight
(Well-l-l, well
Help me out
Help me out, yeah)

You spoil me girl, like a child
When you're not here, I can't even smile
I can't think without you
My mind is always with you
It's amazing what you do
To keep me falling in love with you
Girl you all that I know
Where else can I go?
I say...


Lady, I will cry for you tonight
(Ooh, ooh, no, no, no)
Lady, I will cry for you tonight, tonight
(Help me out baby
Help me out baby, yes
I don’t know how else to say it
I don’t know what else to say
K-Ci help me sing it)
(JoJo, I’m right here, yes I am
I will cry for you lady
Sometimes my pillow gets so wet with tears
I don't have no one to call my own
I want you back, baby
Ooh yeah)

Baby I’m begging, baby I’m begging, begging, baby
(Said I’m beggin’)
Baby I’m begging, baby I’m begging, begging, baby
(uh, Lord have mercy)
(Say I’m begging)
Baby I’m begging, baby I’m begging, begging, baby
(I just can’t take it no more
I don’t give a damn anymore, baby)
Baby I’m begging, baby I’m begging, begging, baby
(Come back, come on back)
Is there anybody out there know what I’m talking about
Somebody, anybody)
Jodeci, let me here you say, YEAH-a, a, ah

Baby, I’m begging, baby, I’m begging, begging, baby
