Check-a check check
I catch wreck with the tech deck
I'm the best yet, kill a set then I jet, jet
Bet bet that I get get all the props
Find me smoking' marijuana crops
Go ahead and call the cops
Shit they can't do a thing
TPS be the new crew to bang
So turn it up up
We're so fine and you the rough cut
Hit the edit lab and review your frame
Chop chop, snip snip
Hip hop till your lid pop off and you flip
Keep a stiff upper lip when I rap
Pull a trick out my hat
Then I bounce in a Honda Civ
Never on the grid
You're not not gonna see me
We got got what you need need
Pot pot buddha weed weed
Rock rock to the beat beat
From Chicago to DC I'm out for the clean sweep
Be prepared to salute your shorts
Lose your drawers
We're gonna run em up the flag pole
I be the hip hop posterboy
That most avoid cuz they be getting punished in a battle
You can't roll with my team
Can't donate a swing
Camp Lo fans know what I mean
Tableau with the theme of a Coppola scene
Get at me
I could show you a thing or two about
How to put a needle to the groove in the record
See most people couldn't do any better than P-Squares
Am I stupid or clever?
Ain't got a clue whatsoever
But everything I do I do to the letter
So take take a breath breath and go
Find me in your tape cassette deck fo sho
A brain case, a meth head, a dope
Vacate the room, room, I'mma let you know know

We did it again, so grab the weed, hit it again
Palmer squares and we in it to win
So throw your hands up
And if you ain't have none
Just jump mad love from the back to front cuz we
Did it again, grab the weed, hit it again
Palmer squares and we in it to win
So throw your hands up
And if you ain't have none
Just jump mad love from the back to front
We give it up

One one to the two
Spun with the crew
Huff huff a balloon till' I'm blue in the face
Stay true to the faith
Of unusual taste
With tools of the trade, I
Lose lose control
Move move your soul
Boom boom till' the room explodes
Sip sip my cup cup
A quick slit, the blunts cut
The piff piff I puff puff
And pass to the left
Then I ask for the check
Masking the stress with a bag full of cess
From an ounce
To a pound
I'm down at the lounge
Buying rounds for my frowning clowns
Whiskey and rye
Get lifted and fly
Drift through the skies
Squinting my eyes
Ignited by the flickering light
Criminal minded
Out for the thrill of the ride
Clean clock with a sock full of batteries
The academy cat, finna pop (yeah right)
That'll be the day
There's fees to pay
Cheese to make
G's to rake
Weed papes
Lemme lead the way
Stone's throw from the po po
Bring on the heat
So cold I'm froze like a sno-cone
Coke nose and the go-gos
We got the beat
Dome blown from a bowl of the home grown
Opium den, dope in the dojo
Smoke smoke putting' holes in the ozone
Show boat with a sold soul
Broke broke like a joke
Mofo got no dough
Get low with your ass and your hips
Scandalous
Smackin' your lips
Term K flick ash from the window
Smooth cat move fast as the wind blow
