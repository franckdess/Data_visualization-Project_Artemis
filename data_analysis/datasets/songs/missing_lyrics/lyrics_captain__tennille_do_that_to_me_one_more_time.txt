Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you

Oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh baby
Do that to me once again

Pass that by me one more time
Once just isn't enough for my heart to hear
Oh, tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I've got you near, oh

Say those words again like you just did
Oh baby
Tell it to me once again


Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Woah, do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you

Oh kiss me like you just did
Oh baby
Do that to me once again

Oh baby
Do that to me once again
Oh baby
Do that to me one more time

(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
