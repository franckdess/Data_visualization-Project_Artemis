You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if you don't wanna dance
You like a four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it
But are you getting it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you getting it?
Ooh, really getting it?
Come get it from me

(Give me all of your loving)
Every little bit
(Give me all that you got)
Every bit of it
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, come on live a bit
(Never want to stop)

Yeah, but are you getting it?
(Armageddon it)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Yes, Armageddon it)
Come on get it
Yeah
Do, do, do
Uh oh

You try coming on when you need some
But then you don't because you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while you're shaking your
And drive the pretty boys out of their heads
You got it
But are you getting it?
You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumping Jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back



Yeah, but are you getting it?
(Armageddon it)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Yes, Armageddon it)
Come on, Steve, get it, huh

Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, come on trigger the gun
Because the best is a yet to come
I say
(Because the best is yet to come)

Oh, are you getting it?
Oh, really getting it?
Yes, are you getting it?
Whoa, really getting it?

Come get it from me
(Give me all of you loving)
Every little bit
(Give me all that you got)
Every bit of it
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, come on live a bit
(Never want it to stop)
Oh, are you getting it?
(Give me all of your loving)
Ooh, really getting it?
(Give me all that you got)
Oh are you getting it?
(Give me all of your loving)
Oh, live a bit
(Give me all that you got)
No, live a bit
You've got to live it
(Give ne all of your loving)
Ooh, baby live it
(Give me all that you got)
Come on and give it
(Every bit of your loving)
Oh, come on and give it
(Never want it to stop)
Oh, are you getting it?
