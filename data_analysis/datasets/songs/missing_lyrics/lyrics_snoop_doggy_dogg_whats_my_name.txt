"Bow Wow (That's My Name)"

Uh, say
Uh, uh, say (My name is)
Say, bow wow wow
Uh, uh, bow wow (Yeah)
Uh, uh, Snoop Dogg (Bow wow)
Yeah, uh, my name is
Hair nappy but I'm happy pocket full of doe
From the C-O representin' So So
The girls recognize in these niggas do to
I'm the flyest they walkin' through junior high school
So make room next to your little backstreet poster
Cause Bow Wow's here and its over; YA HEARD
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
And the big body shotgun ridin' on doves
I've been seen with the baddest
Heard with the best
And I got it lock down from the east to the west
Look at my eyes, ya know; I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets
All hear, sayin' is

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with my now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
And my girls are runnin' where the love
Wherever the love is going down say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with my now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
And all girls are runnin' where the love
Wherever the love is going down

Now at the gates wide open
It is I who they runnin' from
Little with the ill, cross over like Iverson
And to kay my way and I'm the first to rock
First to drop, lice in the bezel of a G-shop
Like B.I.G. and Pac, I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worse, I'm just getting' started
Yeah that's me; that's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah that's me; that's got her arguing with her friends about
Who? Gone, gimme when they see me
Sayin', "Do you?"
Sayin', "Oh! He the man!"
Thirteen, game lock, don't trick, all that and a bag of chips
Hi! My name is


Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Woof motherfucker that dog came to play
Cal gone cal gone take me away
I'm in the dirty dirty with my nephew J
Dizzy, Izzy, boy we getting' busy
With Lil' Bow Wizzy, this shit is off the hizzy
I threw him like a Frisbee
And, "Yeah, he came back."
Like uh, boomerang, Dogg Pound game
Hundred thousand dollar chains
What'chu say J.D.? (J.D.: Bling, bling, money ain't a thang!)
Ya ask me again and I'mma tell you the same
I'm flippin' on these niggas while I'm trippin' on these niggas (trippin')
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
You standin' on the wall, nigga busa (bus)
But you can't trusa, it's good game
And all my niggas represent yo bang
Put it up, now click clack it up
And all the niggas, bag it up
Cause I wanna smack it up
We do it to ya doggystyle (doggystyle)
Big Bow Wow in yo mouth
Bow wow
