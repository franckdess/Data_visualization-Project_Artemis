Ain't it good
Ain't it right
That you are with me here tonight
The music playing
Our bodies swaying in time
(In time, in time, in time)
Touching you
So warm and tender
Lord, I feel such a sweet surrender
Beautiful is the dream that makes you mine
Mmm
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been
Loved like this before
Baby baby
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been
Loved like this before
Oh, my darling
Oh, my baby
You got the moves that drive me crazy
And on your face
I see a trace of love
(Of love, of love, of love)
Come hold me close
Don't let me go
I need you, honey
I love you so
You were made for me by the stars above
Oooh
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been loved like this before
And baby, baby
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been Loved like this before
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been
Loved like this before
Ain't it good
Ain't it right
That you are with me here tonight
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been
Loved like this before
Baby, baby
Rock me gently
Rock me slowly
Take it easy
Don't you know
That I have never been
Loved like this before
