Dear darlin', surprised to hear from me?
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily
Just to let you know
I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid
Time has changed your point of view
How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess
Yes, I'm worried honey
Guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign
Like a hobo in the snow
How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
And just like the first time
We're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style
In the place I've been
And just like the first time
I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door
There'll be no place to hide
How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
