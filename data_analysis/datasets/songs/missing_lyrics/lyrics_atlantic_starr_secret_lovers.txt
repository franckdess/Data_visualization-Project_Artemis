Here we are
The two of us together
Taking this crazy chance
To be all alone
We both know that
We should not be together
Cause if we're found out
It could mess up both our happy homes
I hate to think about us
All meeting up together
Cause soon as I
Looked at you
It would show on my face
Then they'll know that
We've been loving each other
They can never know
No, no, no
We can't leave a trace
Sitting at home
I do nothing all day
But think about you
And hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call
Before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously
Alone by the phone
How could something so wrong
Be so right?
I wish we didn't have to
Keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives
Just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there
Or fall
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
Because we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
You and me
Are we fair?
Is this cruel
Or do we care?
Can they tell
What's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret loves
All of the time
In the middle of making love
We notice the time
We both get nervous
Cause it's way after 9:00
Even though we hate it
We know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful
So that no one will know
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go
Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
So real, so real
