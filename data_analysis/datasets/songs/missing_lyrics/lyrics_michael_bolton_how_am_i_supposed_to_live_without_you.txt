I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone
