Heinz von Foerster did one of these around 1930, to test how evenly major historical events would fill it (not very evenly). And Nigel Calder did a nice 100-page prose version in 1983 called "Timescale: an atlas of the 4th dimension". Choosing a 'NOW' point is problematic (it keeps changing!) but I picked 31Dec 2001 for convenience.
It's precisely divided into 1015 lines covering the Big Bang (NOW minus 10^10.14 years) to 31Dec 2000 (NOW minus 10^0.00, aka one year). If I manage to find one link per line, this will make the page about 100k, which is the maximum Google will index. (This gratifies my desire for 'necessary' web-design: theory. Design rationale:
