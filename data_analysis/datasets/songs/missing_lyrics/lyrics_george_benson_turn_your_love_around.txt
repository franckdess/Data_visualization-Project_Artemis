You've got the love
You've got the power
But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour
For your love
I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believin' in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love
I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you'd get is lonely
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
Oh, don't you let the lady take it
All away
When the woman needs
A taste of yesterday
And he stays at home
All they get is lonely
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
Oh, girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me
We're gonna make it
We're gonna take it
Back where we belong
Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
It's time the girl became a woman
(Don't you turn me down)
Every woman needs a man
(I can show you how)
I love the girl
I love the woman
(Turn your love around)
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
It's time the girl became a woman
(Don't you turn me down)
Every woman needs a man
(I can show you how)
I love the girl
I love the woman
(Turn your love around)
(Turn your love around)
Turn your love around
It's time the girl became a woman
(Don't you turn me down)
Every woman needs a man
(I can show you how)
