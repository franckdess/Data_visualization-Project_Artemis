Darling, I don't know much
But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch
And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep
I'll work myself to death for you
Just to show I adore you
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
'Cause my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep
All I ever, ever hope to be
Depends on your love for me
Baby, believe me
If you should leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell
I know darn well, I can tell, now
I don't know much
But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch
And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep
My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
Well, my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
