I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
Oh, how I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to save us so many times, but still you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up, face reality
It all just seem too good to be true after all you put me through

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love


Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, oh
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
