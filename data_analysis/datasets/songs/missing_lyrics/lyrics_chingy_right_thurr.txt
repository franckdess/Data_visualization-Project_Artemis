Hey dirty, look at that girl right thurr
She make me say:
Ooh, ooh, yeah ooh, ooh.. hey, what you wanna do?

I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking, let down your hurr (let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr

I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (fine)
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime)
The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (grind)
I'm thinking about snatching her up, dirty, making her mine
Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hitting that from the back (back)
I like it when I touch it cause she moan a lil bit
Jeans sagging so I can see her thong a lil bit
I know you grown a little bit, 20 years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swooping down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today

I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr

She be shopping in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl can I taste yo cat
Gave her 300 to strip, like buying a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events, cuss out the press when she pass
All the high rolling cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half stepping, she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gonna drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)

Plus I like it when she bring it back (say it)
Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)
I like the way she doin' that (c'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (say it)
Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)

Gimme what you got for a pork chop
She threw it at me like I was a short-stop
Working in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop
Make it hop - boing - like a bunny
Girl can I touch you where it's sunny
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture perfect site
When she pass all the other girls hate it
(But I...)
