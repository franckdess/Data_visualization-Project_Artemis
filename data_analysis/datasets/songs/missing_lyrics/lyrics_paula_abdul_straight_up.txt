Lost in a dream
I don't know which way to go
(Ah-let me say it now)
If you are all that you seem
Then baby, I'm movin' (Movin') way too slow

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
How about some information, please?

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or are you just havin' fun?

Time's standing still
Waiting for some small clue
(Ah-let me tell ya now)
I keep getting chills
When I think your love (When I think your love) is true

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
How about some information, please?

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or are you just havin' fun?

You are so hard to read
You play hide-and-seek
With your true intentions
If you're only playin' games
I'll just have to say
Abb-b-b-bye, b-b-b-bye

Do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me, baby?)
Do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me? Ah-hey, baby!)
Do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me, baby?)
C'mon now, do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me?)
Ah-tell me, baby

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history book?
I don't mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information, please?
(Please, please, ah, please, please)

Straight up, now tell me (Tell me)
Straight up, now tell me (Tell me)
Straight up, now tell me (Tell me)
Straight up, now tell me
Straight up, now tell me
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or are you just havin' fun?
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together? (Oh, oh, oh)
Or are you just havin' fun?
