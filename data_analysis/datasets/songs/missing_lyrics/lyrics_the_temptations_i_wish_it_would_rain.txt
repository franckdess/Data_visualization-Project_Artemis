Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange

But I wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside (Such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying, ooh, eases the pain
Oh yeah, people, this hurt I feel inside, words could never explain

I just wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh, let it rain, rain, rain, rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh baby, let it rain (Let it rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the windowpane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying (Crying, crying, crying)
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside, my tears I refuse to explain

Oh I wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, let it rain, let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes (Rain, rain, rain, let it rain)
Oh, let it rain (Doo doo doo doo)

Oh yeah, yeah, listen (Let it rain, let it rain)
I'm a man and I got my pride (Rain, rain, rain, rain, let it rain)
'Til it rains I must be inside (Doo doo doo doo)
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
