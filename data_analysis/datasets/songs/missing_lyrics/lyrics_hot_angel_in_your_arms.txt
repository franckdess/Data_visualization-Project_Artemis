ANGEL IN YOUR ARMS
Do you think I'm such a fool to believe everything you say is true
That just goes to show
That you really don't know
While you're out paintin' the town
Do you think I'm home just sittin' around waitin' on you
Now who's really the fool
When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holdin' on when love was already gone
The times you said you weren't feelin' well
Did you think I couldn't tell you'd been with someone else
You were only kiddin' yourself
When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
