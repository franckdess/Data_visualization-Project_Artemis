Time keeps on slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly
Fly right into the future

I wanna feed the babies
Who can't get enough to eat
Wanna shoe the children
With no shoes on their feet
I wanna house the people
Livin' in the street
Oh, yeah, there's a solution

Let me fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let that spirit carry me
I want to fly, oh, yeah
Fly right into the future

Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
Time flies, don't it
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future, oh
Time flies, don't it, baby

Ooh, keep on flying, keep on flying, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah
Don't it, baby
Hey

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly
Fly right into the future
(To the rhythm, baby)

I want to fly like an eagle (Fly like an eagle wanna fly)
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let that spirit carry me
I want to fly (Fly like an eagle wanna fly)
Fly right into the future

In a sky full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy? Oh-oh, oh-oh
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
