The game of love is to live it up and, baby, not too high
Don't you know, if you wanna get down with Mister P
You gotta go and let your backbone slide
What a feeling when you push it up, push it down
You gotta push it up, push it down, feel good
George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you
Baby, don't tease, ooh, just please
'Cause you know it's just me and you
All or nothing (hush)
It's got to be
Something gotta show when you're livin' under heat
All or nothing (hush)
Girl, let it be
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat
I'm under heat, oh, baby, please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe our love will grow
I want a suitor, baby, and make it right
Take it from me, babe, I wanna rock all night
If it's good for me, it's good for you
You gotta never let your mood get dry
Just keep it wet and my 740 jet
Is pushing right on high
George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you
Baby, don't tease, ooh, just please
'Cause you know it's just me and you
All or nothing (hush)
It's got to be
Something gotta show when you're livin' under heat
All or nothing (hush)
Girl, let it be
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat
I'm under heat, oh, baby, please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe our love will grow
I want a suitor, baby, and make it right
Take it from me, babe, I wanna rock all night
Push it up, push it down
Push it where it feels real good
On my lips, my sweet bumble bee
Sting me like I knew you could
All or nothing (hush)
It's got to be
Something gotta show when you're lyin' under me
All or nothing (hush)
Girl, let it be
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat
