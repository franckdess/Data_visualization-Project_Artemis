My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
(Ohhhhhh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
Oh, love
I'll be a fool
For you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

Cause you
You mean the world to me
Oh
I know
I know
I've found in you
My endless love

Oooh-woow
Boom, boom 


And, yes
You'll be the only one
Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless love
