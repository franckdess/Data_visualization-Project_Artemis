Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing
Tempt me, drive me
Feels so exciting
Thought of highly
It's yours entirely
I'll be

I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover (I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you (I'll be)
More than a lover
More than a woman
Even more under covers (I'll be more)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you

Midnight grindin'
Heart rate's climbin'
You go, I go
'Cause we share pillows
Chase me, leave me
There's still no separating
Morning massages
With new bones in your closet, I'll be

I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover (I said I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you (I'll be more)
More than a lover (More)
More than a woman
Even more under covers (I'm gonna be more, baby)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you

I don't think you're ready
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
For this thing
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
You're not ready
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)
This thing, this thing
(I don't think you're ready for this thing)

Constant pleasures
No scale can measure
Secrets, treasures
Keeps on getting better
Do you wanna roll with me?
We can go to foreign lands
With your hand in my hand
Do you wanna ride with me?
We can be like Bonnie & Clyde
Me by your side

I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than your lover
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
More than a lover
More than a woman
Even more under covers
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than enough for you
