Sun tanned toes tickling the sand
Cold drink chilling in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Resting up for a long, long night

Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

All day long just takin' it easy
Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

We'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kennys' hotter when the sun goes down

Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
