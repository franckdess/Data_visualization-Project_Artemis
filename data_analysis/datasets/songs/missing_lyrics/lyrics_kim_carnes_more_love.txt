Let it be soon don't hesitate
Make it now don't wait
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start
When I can fill your heart with
More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey now my love will be so sound
It'll take a hundred life times
To live it down
Wear it down
Tear it down
This is no fiction this is no act
This is real it's a fact
I'll always belong only to you
Each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you
More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey now my love will be so sound
It'll take a hundred life times
To live it down
Wear it down
Tear it down
As we grow older no need to fear
When you need me
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful
And keeping you youthful with
More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey now my love will be so sound
It'll take a hundred life times
To live it down
Wear it down
Tear it down
