Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?
Horses chasing cause they're racing
So they ain't so far
On a carousel, on a carousel
Nearer and nearer by changing horses, still so far away
People fighting for their places just get in my way
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
Still we're going round
On a carousel, on a carousel
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too
As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before
Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die
On a carousel, on a carousel
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too
Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?
Now we take our ride together
No more chasing her
On a carousel, on a carousel
