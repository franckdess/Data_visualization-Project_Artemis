Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
Like in bowling when you got your first strike
It's like now I'm hitchhiking on the turnpike
I broke free from doin' life, now it's midnight
Then God comes along with a ride, invites me inside
I offer stuff to compensate
He doesn't want no payment – says, Brother, it's all be covered
It's tough to take – I say, Lord, I'm a lousy clown, why'd You stop to save me
You must be crazy, man, I'm such a waste
Where we goin'? I'm redeeming you – no you ain't
I'm bad, and someone like that can't become a saint
It's too ingrained – He said, there's no one good – you're goin' straight
I took command, and I'm winnin' you back – your soul is saved
But, Lord, my past was awful, I feel so estranged
I'm trapped – Who trapped you? I don't see no ball and chain
I laid hands on you – you'll never do this alone again
I guess you don't know the Lord's grace
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
You know, they struck His body so much
He could breathe when they hit Him
But Jesus, He did not refuse, even though they whipped Him
Not a warm, fuzzy feeling, gettin' killed just for livin'
Like He's some punk they didn't know from Adam
The Lord, He said, forgive 'em
When they did those things to hurt Him
Though they spit upon His face and invented stuff to curse and convict Him
They plucked out his facial hair
Laughed while givin' Him a thorny crown
Pinned Him to a cross in the Roman mannerism
Yet they gave Him a cold drink to cope with though
Something infinitesimal, a gesture made
Guess that they didn't know that in their painkilling recipe
Something was left over from a different day
One that came with frankincense and gold
It was embalmer's myrrh
Mixed with wine – He still refrained
You don't get it, Wonder Man, Christ was not immune to pain
But it's not in vain
Now the rest of us receive God's forgiveness
Guess that's why they say "no pain no gain"
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
Now I know I said things, did things that were pretty mean
And we fall back to the days of Adam and days of Eve
But Your temptation was bad as mine is, from A to Z
Yet You never flunked the test like I did
You made it clean somehow
They cussed at You, nailed You to a tree
Maybe it was Satan just shiftin' the blame to You from me
Maybe that's what happens when some fourth graders meet with Darth Vader
All I know is the devil's too much for us to face now
The Messiah picked up my tab 'cause He died for all
Though I see sin starin' me in my face when I fall
Though I'm just a slimeball
Took me in when I called
Yes, I'm enlistin' as a Christian disciple
Guess it's time here for me to testify
I will follow Christ even through my lowest times
"Cause I know I became righteous from the fact I know my Messiah
If the devil tries to sucker me again
I'm a try and do my best to just renounce that liar
Don't understand why they brought You myrrh
But that's all right because I like Your day of birth
Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ
But that's all right because I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
I lived the day You died
