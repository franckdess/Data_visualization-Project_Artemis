I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
(I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
(Yeah, I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)

Yeah, you gonna remember me, boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shit we used to do
You was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying, you got a man anyway
I can't explain it either, I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see ya
When I see ya I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on before I could say...

I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet? (When you've had a long day)
Scratch your scalp? (When you take out your braids)
Does she know that you like to play PS2 'til 6 in the morning like I do?

I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

Guess I gotta live my life from day to day
Hoping maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on, but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
Though I know I should be content
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead? (Before we play)
Show up on my doorstep? (With a bouquet)
Does he call me in the middle of the day just to say, "Baby, I love you" (Like you used to?)

I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

I'm gonna remember you (You're gonna remember me)
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me; my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing
Sometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing
Sometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging
And I realize how much I'm bugging
I miss you

So hard to express this feeling
'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)
And you know she'll never love you like I do (Yeah)

I can't explain this feeling (Uh-uh)
I think about it every day (Yeah)
And even though we've moved on (Yeah)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (Walk away)
Walk away (Walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, no...)
I can't explain this feeling (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
I think about it every day (Forever you will live in my memory)
And even though we've moved on (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (?)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (yeah)
(I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (remember you, yeah)
(I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (yeah-h-h-h)
