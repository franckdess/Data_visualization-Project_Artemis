Did you know I'd go to sleep and leave the lights on
Hoping you'd come by and know that I was home, still awake
But two years go by and still my light's on
This is hard for me to say, but this is all that I can take
It's the last song I'll ever write for you
It's the last time that I'll tell you just how much I really care
This is the last song I'll ever sing for you
You'll come looking for the light and it won't be there
But I love you
Oh, yes I do
Yes I do
All the times that I spent waiting, wondering where you are
Always knew the time would come when I would start to wonder why
Now the time is here, I don't know where you are
So I'll write you one more song, but it's the last time that I'll ever try
It's the last song I'll ever write for you
It's the last time that I'll tell you just how much I really care
This is the last song I'll ever sing for you
You'll come looking for the light and it won't be there
But I love you
Oh, yes I do
Yes I do
It's the last song I'll ever write for you
It's the last song I'll ever write for you
It's the last song I'll ever write for you
