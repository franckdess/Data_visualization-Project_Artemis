Hmm, hold on tight to your dream
Hey, hold on tight to your dream
When you see your ship go sailing
When you feel your heart is breaking
Hold on tight to your dream, hmm

It's a long time to be gone (Hold on, hold on)
Oh, time just rolls on and on (Hold on, hold on)
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying, just-a...
Hold on tight to your dream

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over, and over, and over you could

Accroche-toi à ton rêve
Accroche-toi à ton rêve
Quand tu vois ton bateau partir
Quand tu sens ton cœur se briser
Accroche-toi à ton rêve

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over, and over, and over you could

Hold on tight to your dream, hey
Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
When you see the shadows falling
When you hear that cold wind calling
Hold on tight to your dream

Oh, yeah
Hold on tight to your dream
Yeah, hold on tight... to your dream
