Yeah... People talk a lot...
You've just got to find a way to block it out...
It's Jimmy!

Yeah, I was six years old when my mom told me give it all, never hold back
So for a few years I would try real hard and I had my moments, no Kodak
Relocated from the city to a small town and I moved to a school so notorious
And I felt so out of place so it's no lie when the song tell the story of
A shy kid, never talked back, feelings hidden by the shades and the ball cap
So all their weird looks had me feeling trapped, as others thought of me thinking I was all that
And it's funny how they never caught that vibe of a kid that was heading down a dark path
And that all their words only made it worse but they just laughed when they walked past, so I'm...

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go...

Lost in the world, keep searching. Grind real hard, putting work in
But I still can't see no light at the end of the tunnel, is it worth it?
And I heard them say if you're always on the move you won't ever feel the world spin
Well, if that's true then that must be the reason I feel like I'm caught up in a whirlwind
Stuck, all I need is a little luck, tailwind, a few bucks - I'ma show this
Whole world that I've got it all planned and whatever goes down I won't ever lose focus
So sick of being told this goddamn lie that I'll never get noticed
Trapped in a town all bogus, like a great white in a gold fish bowl, bitch
I stay cool, try to get it on
Bet it all on this dream they are shitting on
I ain't saying that I'm better y'all, I'm just little too big for your little pond
Sick of being told I can not be the greatest at what I do, just watch me
'cause I know what I'm doing and Alex already told me that he got me, that's why I'm...

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
I find a way to block it
I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
I find a way to block it, I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
I find a way to block it
I go
La la la la la...
La la la la la...
