(Oh!) The waves keep on crashing on me for some reason
(Oh!) But your love keeps on coming like a thunderbolt
Well come here a little closer
'Cause I wanna see you, baby, real close up
(Get over here, get over here)

You got me feelin' hella good so let’s just keep on dancin'
(Oh!) You hold me like you should so I’m gonna keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')

A performance deserving of standing ovations
(Oh!) And who would of thought it’d be the two of us?
(I didn't really think it could ever happen, haha)
So don’t wake me if I’m dreaming
'Cause I’m in the mood, come on and give it up
(Oh, oh, oh!)

You got me feelin' hella good so let’s just keep on dancin'
(Oh!) You hold me like you should so I’m gonna keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')
You got me feelin' hella good so let’s just keep on dancin'
(Oh!) You hold me like you should so I’m gonna keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')

Ooh, yeah yeah!
Ooh, yeah yeah!
(Oh!)
(I might've thought that but I've been trapped by what happened) 

You got me feelin' hella good so let’s just keep on dancin'
(Oh!) You hold me like you should so I’m gonna keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')
You got me feelin' hella good so let’s just keep on dancin'
(Oh!) You hold me like you should so I’m gonna keep on dancin'
(Keep on dancin')

(Oh!)
(Uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh)
(Oh!)
(Uh, uh, uh)
(Oh!)
(Keep on dancin')
(Oh!)
(Oh!)
(Keep on dancin')
