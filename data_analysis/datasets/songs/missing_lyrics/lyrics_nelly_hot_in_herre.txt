It's hot in... so hot in herre! So hot in... hot - OH!

With a little bit of, uh uh; and a little bit of, uh uh
Just a little bit of...  just a little bit of...
Just a little bit of...  just a little bit of...

I was like, good gracious - ass is bodacious (uhh)
Flirtacious, tryin to show patience
I'm waitin for the right time to shoot my steez (you know)
Waitin for the right time to flash them keys, then uhh
I'm leavin, please believe in - ohhh!
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feedin
No deceivin, nuttin up my sleeve and
No teasin.. I need you to
Get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin for
Cause I feel like bustin loose
And I feel like touchin you, uh uh
And can't nobody stop the juice
So baby tell me what's the use? I said

It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am - gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am - gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Uh, uh, uh - let it hang alll out!

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin the bottles? (c'mon)
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin the models
I see you drivin, sports cars, ain't hittin the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Got off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweatin, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tanktop, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin your reflection and tellin your best friend
Like "Girl I think my butt gettin big!"

It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am - gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes

I'm just kidding like Jason (oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra - eh, spread the news (check it)
Nelly took a trip from the Lou' to the Neptunes
Came back with somethin thicker than fittin in Sasoons
Say she got a thing about cuttin in restrooms - ohhhhh!
