Yeah! Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?

Now, I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and  I
I'm going to love you
Till the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I


Stronger than dirt
