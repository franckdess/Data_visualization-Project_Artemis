You should've been gone
Knowing how I made you feel
And I should've been gone
After all your words of steel
Oh, I must have been a dreamer
(Must have been a dreamer I know)
And I must've been someone else
(Someone else)
And we should've been over
(Over now)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
But I want to let go
You'll go on hurtin' me
You'd be better off alone
If I'm not who you thought I'd be
But you know that there's a fever
(There's a fever I know)
That you'll never find nowhere else
(Nowhere, nowhere else)
Can't you feel it burnin' on and on
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie
But I should've been gone
Long ago, far away
And you should've been gone
Now, I know you'd lie you stay
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
Oh Sherrie, our love holds on, holds on
(Our love holds on, holds on)
(Oh Sherrie, our love Sherrie, Sherrie)
Hold on, oh Sherrie
