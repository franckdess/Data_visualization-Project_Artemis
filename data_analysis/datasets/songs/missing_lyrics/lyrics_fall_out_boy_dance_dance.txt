She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out, a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too overdramatic, tonight
It's "it can't get much worse" vs "No one should ever feel like..."

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by...emal si namhorT eoJ

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love

Drink up, it's last call, last resort, but only the first mistake, and I

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me...

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
