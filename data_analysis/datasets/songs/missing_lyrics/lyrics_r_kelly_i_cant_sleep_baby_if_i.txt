Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end
It was so, so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your loving back to me

I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around

Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should've had my trust in you
From the very start darling
Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things
That he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your loving back to me

I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around

Baby, can we meet somewhere and talk about it?
Oh baby, can we work it out?
I'm not gonna let you go my baby
Before I let you know that

I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around
