Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
There lived the Cajun lady aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Mississippi queen
If you know what I mean
Mississippi queen
She taught me everything

This lady she asked me if I would be her man
You know that I told her I'd do what I can
To keep her looking pretty, buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes were making their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was losing mine


You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were getting their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Oh, Mississippi Queen
