I see you, Ryan
Yo, Keith, you was right
But we just getting started
Yeah, man

You say you're searching for somebody that'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here, baby and let daddy show you what it feel like
You know all you got to do is tell me what you sipping on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it coming all night long

Looking in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that shawty, I got a thing for you
Doing it on purpose, winding and working it
I can tell by the way you looking at me, girl

I wanna make love in this club (hey)

You got some friends rolling with you, baby, then that's cool
You can leave them with my homies, let them know that I got you
If you didn't know, you're the only thing that's on my mind
'Cause the way I'm staring at you got me wanna give it to you all night

Looking in the eyes while you walk the other side
I can't take it no more, baby, I'm coming for you
You keep doing it on purpose, winding and working
If we close our eyes, it could just be me and you

I'm what you want, I'm what you need
He got you trapped, I'll set you free
Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally
I'll be like your medicine, you'll take every dose of me
It's going down on aisle 3, I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think about it, you gon' want some more of me
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go

Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doing
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watching
Watching, watching
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love

I wanna make love in this club (hey)

In this club (hey)
I wanna make love in this club (hey)
