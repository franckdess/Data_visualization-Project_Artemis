Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble
If you left me now
Cause I don't know where
To look for love
I just don't know how
Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time
You would always be
All my friends call me a fool
They say
Let the woman take care of you
And so I
I try to be hip
And think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now
Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Oh, girl
Tell me what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl
I feel so out of place
Ooh, ooh
(Ooh)
Yeah, yeah
(Doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo)
I don't know
I don't know where to go
Who to see
Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
All my friends call me a fool
They say
Let the woman take care of you
But
Oh, whoa
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl
I've gotta get away from here
Oh, girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know where
To look for love
(And I don't)
I don't know how
(Ooh)
I don't know how
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Better be on my way
I can't stay here
(Ooh)
Ooh, ooh
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Have you ever seen such a helpless man?
Oh, oh
(Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Just don't know
I don't know where to go
No, no
(Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo doo, doo)
