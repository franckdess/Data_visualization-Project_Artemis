(Ooh, ooh, ah)

Now I told you, so you ought to know (ooh)
It takes some time for a feeling to grow (ooh)
But you're so close now, I can't let you go (ooh)
And I can't let go

(With you I'm not shy) to show the way I feel
(With you I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel

I can't hope that I'll hold you for long (ooh)
You're a woman who's lost to your song (ooh)
But the love that I feel is so strong (ooh)
And it can't be wrong

(With you I'm not shy) to show the way I feel
(With you I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

(With you I'm not shy) to show the way I feel
(With you I might try) my secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet and I am steel

For you are a magnet and I am steel
For you are a magnet and I am steel
