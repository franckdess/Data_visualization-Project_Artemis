Baby let's cruise, away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
This is not a one night stand, baby, yeah so
Let the music take your mind, ooh
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Baby tonight belongs to us
Every thing's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other ooh baby, yeah
So let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Cruise with me baby
Cruise, cruise
Baby let's cruise, let's flow, let's glide
Ooh let's open up, and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you baby
Let the music, take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away
Yeah, I'm glad you're going my way
I love it, when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
I love it, when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love
