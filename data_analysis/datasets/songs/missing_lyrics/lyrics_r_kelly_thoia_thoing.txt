To who made need to know
That's her on the flo'
Sliding down the pole
Horny but fo sho'
Both our hands we're up
Drinks was in the cup
She showed me some love
So we left the club
Now we up in the Hummer V
She's so hot she's kissing on me
This is the girl of my fantasy
After the Remy we were doing our thing

I had her singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing
She had me singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing

Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing
Now I don't know about you
But I would like to get wit two(ah)
Nice honies while I'm chillin' by the pool (ah)
Red bikinis with some pump heel shoes (ah)
Who could think of any damn thing cool (ah)
We at the crib so it ain't no rules (ah)
I'm butt naked, sweat socks, and house shoes (ah)
100 bottles of cris in the cool (ah)
I'm frozen thanks the Jacob the Jeweler
One day without me and she's shaking like a fiend (ah)
Y'all tell me what's r&b without the R (ah)

I had her singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing thoing

I met a girl in the shopping mall
She had hazel eyes said she's from Africa
She broke it down right in front of me
Rolling on her knees I said I'm scared of ya
Tattoo on her back lovin' the way she work it
Body movin' like she's dancin' in a circus
Back forth up down when jerk it
Put the thoia thoing on now watch I murda it

I had her singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing
She had me singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing

We make a lot of noise
When, we come through the club
All of the ladies in the house
Come show your boy some love
Last call for alcohol(nah)
We're closing down the bar
Tell me where's the after party at
We rolling with the R

I had her singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing thoing
