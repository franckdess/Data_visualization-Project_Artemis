Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Uh, my life is a cage but on stage I'm free
Hyped up, psyched up, ready for wildin'
Standing in a crowd of girls like a island
I see the one I want, I said "come here cutie"
I flip her around and then I work that booty
Work the body, work, work the body
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody
Hold up, yo let's get just one thing clear
There's only one reason why I came here
]
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (GO)
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (GO)
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (GO)
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go

(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom)
]
Well yo are ya'll ready for me yet?
(Pump it up Prince)
Well yo are ya'll ready for me yet?
(Pump it up Prince)
Well yo are ya'll ready for me yet?
(Pump it up Prince)
Well here I go, here I go here I, here I go

Yo, dance in the aisles when the Prince steps to it
The rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw
How do I know?, because the crowd went (HO)
In response to the way that I was kicking it
Smooth, an individual, rhymes always original
Like the Dr. Jekyll man and this is my 'Hyde' side
I am the driver and you're on a rap ride
So fellas (yeah)
Are y'all with me? (yeah)
I said fellas (yeah)
Are y'all with me? (yeah)
Why don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do
Ya wanna (oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ew)
That's right yo and I'm in the flow
So pump up the volume along with the tempo
I want everybody in the house to know
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go
]

Yeah
Break it on DOWN, uh
Yeah, give 'em it
Uh, bring it back to 'em
Yeah, c'mon now
 - w/ ad libs
"Mix" - repeated



Here I go
The F-f-f-f-Fresh P-p-p-p-Prince is who I am
So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam
But sometimes I get n-nervous and start to stutter
And I f-fumble every word, for word I utter
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it
They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling
Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow
So pump up the volume, along with the tempo
Many have died trying to stop my show
I came here tonight to here the crowd go
]

Yeah, uh
Kick it to 'em right here
Don't stop
All night long
And I'm outta here
