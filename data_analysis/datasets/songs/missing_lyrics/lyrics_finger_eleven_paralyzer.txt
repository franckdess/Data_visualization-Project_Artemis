I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

Not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

You'll probably move right through me on my way to you
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you
