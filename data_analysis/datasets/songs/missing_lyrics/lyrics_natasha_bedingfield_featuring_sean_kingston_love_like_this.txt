Ooh, oh (Talk to 'em, babe)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Never find a love like this
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Hey)
Never find a love like this

Well, we go back so far
Swinging in your backyard
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
Ooh, I really liked you
Must've been your attitude

That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you

You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this
(Love like this)

All the guys tried to take me
You're the one who saved me
I feel like I owe you my life
And as strange as it may seem
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice

That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by
It's not hard to know why
I keep coming back to you

You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Ooh, look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Oh, wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this

Mi never find a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
I sit here in this chair and I wish
For you not to leave me now (Let's go)
My friends, they always told me
Not to make you my wifey
Man, they was putting you down
And now they see we rolling
Me and you, we strolling
They don't wanna come around

(Let me hear you say) You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this
