You tell me that you're leaving
I can't believe it's true
Girl, there's just no living
Without you
Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
Cause if you go then I'll be blue
Breaking up is hard to do
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up, I wish that we were making up again
I beg of you, don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love just one more try
Come on baby, let's start anew
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is oh so hard to do
