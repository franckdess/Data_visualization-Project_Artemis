I know tonight she comes
She's takin' a swipe at fun
She gives me a reason
For sighting my sights
Well I know tonight she comes
She jangles me up
She does it with ease
And sometimes she passes through me
Just like a breeze
She gives me a reason
For feelin' all right
Oh well
(know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight
(know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight
(know tonight, I know tonight)
She comes
And I know she's gonna do it to me
One more time (one more time)
I know she's gonna stay implanted
In my mind
Why does she keep me hanging on the line, oh
(why does she keep me hanging on the liiiiiiine)
Ah yeah, I know she's gonna do it to me
One more time (one more time)
I know she's gonna stay implanted
In my mind
Oh, why does she keep me hanging on the line, oh yeah
(why does she keep me hanging on the liiiiiiine)
I know the way she feels
And all of the hearts that she steals
She tells me it's easy
When you do it right
Oh well, ell I know tonight she comes
(I know tonight she comes)
She tells me it's easy
When you do it right
(know tonight, I know tonight) I know tonight
(know tonight, I know tonight) I know tonight
(know tonight, I know tonight) she comes
(she comes)
I know tonight, oh yeah
(know tonight, I know tonight)
(I know tonight) well I know tonight
(know tonight, I know tonight)
Know tonight she comes
She's takin' a swipe at fun
She gives me a reason
For sighting my sights
Well I know tonight she comes
She jangles me up
She does it with ease
And sometimes she passes through me
Just like a breeze
She gives me a reason
For feelin' all right
