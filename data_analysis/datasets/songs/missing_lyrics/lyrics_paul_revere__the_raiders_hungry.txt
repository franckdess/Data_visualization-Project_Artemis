Girl you got this need to know what I'm all about
There is something that you dig you can't figure out
Well now you want to know what moves my soul
And what ticks inside of my brain
But I've got this need I just can't control and it's
A-drivin' me insane, I can't take it

'Cause I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you
I could almost taste it, baby
And it's sweet as wine

A custom tailored world that I want to own, some day
It's a special place up high we can stay alone, you and me
Girl, I'm gonna have it all someday if you'll just hang on to my hand
If I break some rules along the way, girl, you You gotta understand
It's my way of gettin' what I want now, 'cause I'm hungry

Yes, I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
Well, I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you
I can almost taste it now
Oh, it's sweet as wine
I ain't gonna waste it now
When it's finally mine

Gonna live each minute, fill the hours and days
'Til I've had my fill, ah girl, I'll be rollin' in it
Yes, yes, you know I will, yes I will


'Cause I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you

Just can't take it now
You can help me make it now, ah
I'll be your big big man
Oh girl, 'cause I'm hungry

Hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you
