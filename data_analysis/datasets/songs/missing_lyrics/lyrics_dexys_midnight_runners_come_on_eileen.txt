Come on Eileen!
Come on Eileen!

Poor old Johnnie Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You've grown (You’re grown up!)
So grown (So grown up!)
Now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts (I confess)
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on Eileen
(Come on Eileen!)

These people round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (No never)
But not us (Not ever)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And you'll hum this tune forever, oh

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
Aah, come on let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Aah, come on let's
Aah, come on Eileen
That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Aah, come on let's
Aah, come on Eileen
Please

(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Tooh rah, tooh ra, tah roo rye)
Now you're full grown
Now you have shown
Oh, Eileen
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-ay)
(Tooh rah, tooh ra, tah roo rye)
Say, come on Eileen (You’ve grown)
These things they are real and I know (So grown)
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever
Things round here have changed
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on Eileen, tah-loo-rye-aye)
I say, too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye-ay

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Aah, come on Eileen

Aah, come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress
Oh, my thoughts I confess
Well, they're dirty
Come on Eileen

Come on Eileen (Oh)
What he means (Oh)
You mean everything (Oh)
(Come on! come on!)
In that dress
Oh

Oh believe me if all those endearing young charms
That I gaze on so fondly today
Were to suddenly leave you, or fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky
