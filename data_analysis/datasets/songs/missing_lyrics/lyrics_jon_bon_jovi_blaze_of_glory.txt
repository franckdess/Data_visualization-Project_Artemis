I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun


Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun
Young gun
