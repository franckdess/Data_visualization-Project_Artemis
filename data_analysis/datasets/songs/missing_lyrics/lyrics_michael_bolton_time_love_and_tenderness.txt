Time, love and tenderness

So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'?
What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view, oh no
Nothing is as sad as it seems, you know

Some day, you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day, you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow, you'll get through the heartbreak
Somehow, you can get through the rain

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness, oh

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So baby, don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time to make it better
The hurt won't last forever, oh no
All your tears are all gonna dry, you know

Some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But baby, that old luck's gonna change

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Baby, all you need, all you need is
Some time, love and tenderness

The hurt ain't gonna last forever, no
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Little bit of time, love and tenderness

Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness (Time, love, all you need)
Time, love and tenderness (All you need)
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness (Some time, some love)
Time, love and tenderness, baby

When love puts you through the fire (All you need)
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart (Some time, love and tenderness)
Like some time, love and tenderness
You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
