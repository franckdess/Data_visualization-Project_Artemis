Children grow and women producing
Men go working, some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
BX, uh (South side Bronx)
(South side Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (South side Bronx, from the Bronx)

From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm real)
I'm real even on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh (South side Bronx)

I'm down to earth like this
Rocking this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real (Real)
To me it's like breathing, yeah (South side Bronx)

I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
