Muskrat, muskrat
Candlelight
Doin' the town
And doin' it right in the evening
It's pretty pleasing
Muskrat Suzie
Muskrat Sam
Do the jitterbug at a Muskrat Land
And they shimmy
Sam is so skinny
And they whirl
And they twirl and they tango
Singing and jingling a jangle
Float like the heavens above
Looks like Muskrat Love
Nibbling on bacon
Chewing on cheese
Sam says to Suzie
Honey, would you please be my Mrs
Suzie says yes with her kisses
Now, he's tickling her fancy
Rubbing her toes
Muzzle to muzzle
Now anything goes as they wriggle
Sue starts to giggle
And they whirled
And they twirled and they tango
Singing and jingling a jangle
Floating like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love
