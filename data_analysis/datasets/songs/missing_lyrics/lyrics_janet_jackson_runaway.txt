Excuse me
There we go

I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh, under the moon glow, down in Mexico
I dreamed, one thing was missing that's you

Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll sail the waters of many colors
Won't need no compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I want to share the world with you, you see
Springtime in Paris feels so good to me
Oh, this is for me reality, so please
Make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
Oh, please come with me
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
It'll be fun walking in the rain in Spain
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
(Ooh, didn't quite hit the note!
That wasn't such a good time!)
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
Don't you think so? I do!
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
