Well, life on a farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
A-raisin' me a family and working on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's setting low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy
Whoo

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farming tools
Thank God I'm a country boy
Yeah, city folk driving in a black limousine
A lot of sad people thinking that's a-mighty keen
Well son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy


Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
Thank God you're a country boy."
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's coming up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
Whoo, thank God I'm a country boy, yes!
