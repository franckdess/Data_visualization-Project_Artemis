So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture-show
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

Cause you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good
Well, take the long way home
Take the long way home

There are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery
Is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar
She used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home

You never see what you wanna see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

And when you're up on the stage it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable
How they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity
Is there no way out?
Oh yeah!


Does it feel that you life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be
For you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you would had more time

So when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Do it again
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Oh yah!
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
Ooh, yeah
You took the long way home

Aah aah aah aah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Aah aah aah aah

Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
Long way home
