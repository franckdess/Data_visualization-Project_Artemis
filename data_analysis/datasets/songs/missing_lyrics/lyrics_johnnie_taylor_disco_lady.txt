Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady
Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it around, disco lady
Hey sexy lady
Said I like the way
You move your thang
Lord, have mercy, girl
You dance so fine
And you're right on time
Girl you ought to be on TV on Soul Train
When you get the groove
It ain't no stopping
Just can't help it
But I'm, I'm finger pop-ping
Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady
Shake it baby, shake it
Baby, shake your thang
Shake it baby, shake it
Baby, shake your thang
You got me grooving
I feel like moving
You got me loving
Can't sit still
I'm grooving
I like that funky stuff
Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Shove it in, move it out
Move it in and about, disco lady
Hey sexy lady
Girl, you drive me crazy
You dance so fine
And you're right on time
Girl, you're driving me out of my mind
If it wasn't for the girl
Sitting next to me
I'd jump right up and out-ta my safety seat
You got me hypnotized
Soul mesmo-ized
Girl, you're moving me
Girl, you're groovin' me
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Shove it in and about, disco lady
Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Shove it in and about, disco lady
Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
