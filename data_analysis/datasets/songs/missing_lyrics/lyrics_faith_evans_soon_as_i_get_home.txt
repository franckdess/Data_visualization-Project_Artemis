Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't want to lose you
So baby...

Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

Sleepless nights and lonely days are all that fill my head
All of the time, oh baby
But all I do, is think about the way you make me feel
'Cause baby, this love is so real

Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

If I try to spend some time with you to make you happy
Would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love, so in love

Making love all through the night
We could hold each other tight
I can take away the pain
If you would only let me
Just forget about the past
'Cause I want to make it last
Baby, I apologize
'Cause boy, I really need you in my life

Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

Baby, if you give me just another chance (Oh baby)
I can show you love (More love)
Promise I'll be true to you
(You don't ever have to worry)
Don't ever have to worry (No, no, no)
'Cause I'm gonna treat you right
(Baby, I miss you)
Baby, I miss you, just want to kiss you
Hold you in my arms

Soon as I get home
Baby, I know what I gotta do
'Cause I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home
Baby, I know what I gotta do
'Cause I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home
Baby, I know what I gotta do
'Cause I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home
Baby, I know what I gotta do
'Cause I don't need no one but you
