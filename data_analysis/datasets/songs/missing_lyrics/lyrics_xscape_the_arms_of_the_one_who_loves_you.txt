I know you're going
I can't make you stay
I can only let you know I love you any way
And if the road you take leads to heartbreak
Somewhere down the line
If someone ever hurts you
Or treats your heart unkind

You just run to the arms of the one who loves you
You just run to these arms
And these two arms will keep you warm
When rain has found your heart
Never fear, I'm never far
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you

I want you happy
I want the best for you
And if you have to leave to find your dream
I hope that dream comes true
But if the world you find brings you hard times
If someone makes you cry
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be standing by


My love is strong enough, you know
Strong enough to let you go
But I'll always hold you
Inside my heart
(And if you should ever change your mind
You can come back any time)
And when you do (and when you do)
