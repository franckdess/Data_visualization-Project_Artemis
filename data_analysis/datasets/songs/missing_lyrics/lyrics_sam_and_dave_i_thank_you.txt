I want everybody to get up off your seat
And get your arms together, and your hands together
And give me some of that old soul clapping

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)

If you took your love somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did but you did
(And I thank you)

Every day it's something new
You pull out your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love, baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out

I want to thank you (Thank you)
Thank you (Oh baby)
Thank you baby (Yeah, yeah)
Oh baby (I gotta be thanking)
Got to say

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, but you did
(And I thank you)

Thank you (Thank you, baby)
Baby (Got to thank you)
Baby (Oh baby)
Thank! I've! Got! I've got to (Thank you, baby)
Thank you, baby (Oh baby)
Thank you, baby (Oh)
Thank you, oh baby
Thank you (Thank you)
