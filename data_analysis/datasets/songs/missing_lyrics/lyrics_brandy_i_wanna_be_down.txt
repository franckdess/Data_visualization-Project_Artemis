I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl you that you could be down for
Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

(Down, down, down) Yeah oh
(Down, down, down) Yeah oh

I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down
