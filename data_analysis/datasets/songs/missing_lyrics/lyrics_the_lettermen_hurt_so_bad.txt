I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It makes me hurt so bad
To see you again
Like needles and pins people say
You've been making out OK
She's in love don't stand in her way
But let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so bad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
Stay I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before please love me again
I can't let you go back to him
Please don't go please don't go
It hurts so bad it hurts so bad it hurts so bad
I'm begging you please please don't go please don't go
