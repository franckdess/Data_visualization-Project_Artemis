I got chills, they're multiplyin'
And I'm losin' control
'Cause the power you're supplyin'
It's electrifyin'!
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand
To my heart I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (The one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes, indeed)
If you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction
Feel your way
I better shape up, 'cause you need a man
I need a man who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up if I'm gonna prove
You better prove that my faith is justified
Are you sure?
'Cause (yes) I'm sure down deep inside
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (The one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes, indeed)
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (The one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes, indeed)
You're the one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (You are the one I want)
Ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (The one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes, indeed)
