Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doing
But you must be living right, yeah
We got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

City traffic's moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit till we get
To the other side
With the radio playing our song
We keep rolling on
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about slowing, slowing down, yeah

City traffic's moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

Here we go, one more time
With the wind and your fingers in my hand
Kind of think we are going for an extended throw down
So drop the top, baby, and let's cruise on into
It's Better Than Ever Street

City traffic's moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

And what I want you to do, baby
(freeway of love) get over in the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh, yeah
(freeway of love) take the love exit
And then make a right turn
(freeway of love) go on over to Love and Satisfaction and Joy Road
Well, ain't we riding baby
Ain't we cruising down?
Free, free, free, freeway go on out to, ow
Let's Be Good to Each Other Street
Freeway! Well
(freeway of love) see that little landmark over there
A whole lot of kisses and sweet stuff
(freeway of love) we'll be just about ow, ow, ow
And Satisfaction Road, yeah (free free free)
Satisfaction, yeah (freeway of love)
(free free free)
(freeway of love)
