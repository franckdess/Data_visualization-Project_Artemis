Love me let me be lonely
Part time love I can find any day
So don't defy mother nature's way please
Make it mine, a love for to stay
I can live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to so I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom
Oh, oh, oh
Do doo, do doo, do doo, do doo
You will or either you won't now
It's up to you I've had my say
So truly love do love me completely
Hey come on, come on come my way
REPEAT CHORUS
