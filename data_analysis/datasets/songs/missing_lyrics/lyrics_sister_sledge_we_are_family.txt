We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody sing
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody sing
Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(Fly) and we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
(All) all of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

We are family
Yeah, yeah, ah
I got all my sisters with me
I have, I have
We are family
Get up everybody sing
(Sing it to me)
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody sing
Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
(High) high hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
(We) no we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh-no
This is our family Jewel

We are family
Yeah, yeah, sing it to me
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Oh I can hear you now
Get up everybody sing
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
(Get up now)
Get up everybody sing
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody sing
We are family
