Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Here we go

Look, I'm betting you like Bebop
And I'm betting you love freak mode
And I'm betting you like girls that give love to girls
And stroke your little ego

I bet you I'm guilty, your honor (honor)
That's just how we live in my genre (genre)
When the hell them plait the rope wider?
There's only one Flo, and one Rida

I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pull a damn hamstring, try'na put it on ya
Let your lips spin back around cover
Slow it down baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby

It's like everywhere I go
My whistle ready to blow
Shorty don't leave a note
She can get any by the low

Permission not approved
It's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano
'Cause girl you can handle

Baby we start snagging
You come up in part clothes
Girl I'm the whistle man
My Bugatti the same road

Show me your perfect pitch
You got it, my banjo
Talented with your lips
Like you blew out the candles

So amusing (musing)
Now you can make a whistle with the music (music)
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it (do it)
Give in if it no fiction, never lose it (lose it)

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby,
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby,
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby

Go girl you can twerk it
Let me see you whistle while you work it
I'mma lay it back, don't stop it
'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me
Now, shorty let that whistle blow, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, baby make that whistle blow, oh, oh

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby?
Here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
Whi-whistle baby, whistle baby
