Sylvia's mother says Sylvia's busy
Too busy to come to the phone
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia's trying
To start a new life of her own
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia's happy
So why don't you leave her alone?
And the operator says forty cents more
For the next three minutes
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her awhile
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia's packing
She's gonna be leaving today
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia's marrying
A fella down Galveston way
Sylvia's mother says please don't say nothing
To make her start crying and stay
And the operator says forty cents more
For the next three minutes
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her awhile
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia's hurrying
She's catching the nine o'clock train
Sylvia's mother says take your umbrella
'Cause, Sylvie, it's starting to rain
And Sylvia's mother says thank you for calling
And, sir, won't you call back again?
And the operator says forty cents more
For the next three minutes
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her a while
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye
Tell her goodbye
Please, tell her goodbye
