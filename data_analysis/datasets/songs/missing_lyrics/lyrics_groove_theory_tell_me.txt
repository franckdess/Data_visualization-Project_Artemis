I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise, ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to

If you've thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal than any man in this whole world
And baby, I got to know how you feel, yeah

Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to

Sweetheart, now it's time I let you know
I don't wanna rush, we should take it slow
Boy, I can love you, can you help me grow
Give me a new beginning and I'll give you a happy ending

Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good for you
I promise, girl, that I'll be true
So tell me if you want me to
Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good for you
I promise, girl, that I'll be true
So tell me if you want me to
