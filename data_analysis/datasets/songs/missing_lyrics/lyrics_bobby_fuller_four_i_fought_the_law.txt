I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
Oh, she's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I'm robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and the good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
Oh, she's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
