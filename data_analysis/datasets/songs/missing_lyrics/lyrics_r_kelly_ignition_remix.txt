Now, usually, I don't do this but, uh
Go head on and break 'em off with a lil' previews of the remix

Now, I'm not trying to be rude
But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in your grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field

So, baby, gimme that "Toot-toot"
And lemme give you that "Beep-beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty-fours
While they sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum (rum)
I'm like, "So what? I'm drunk" (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (fun)

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
C'mon

Now, it's like "Murder She Wrote"
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
But still they can hear you screamin' more
Girl, I'm feelin' what you're feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition

So, gimme that "Toot-toot"
And lemme give you that "Beep-beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty-fours
While they sayin' on the radio (check it out)

It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (wishin' now)
Sippin' on Coke and rum (rum)
I'm like, "So what? I'm drunk" (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (fun)

Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We got food everywhere, as if the party was catered (catered)
We've got fellas to my left (left)
Honies on my right (right)
We bring 'em both together, we got jukin' all night
Then after the show, it's the after party
Yeah, and after the party, it's the hotel lobby
Yeah, around about four, you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to your room and freak somebody

Can I get a "Toot-toot"?
Can I get a "Beep-beep"?
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro (yeah)
Bouncin' on twenty-fours (c'mon)
While they sayin' on the radio (check it out)

It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (c'mon)
Sippin' on Coke and rum (rum)
I'm like, "So what? I'm drunk" (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (check it out)
('Cause it's the) It's the remix to "Ignition"
Hot and fresh out the kitchen (yeah)
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' (wishin' now)
Sippin' on Coke and rum (yeah)
I'm like, "So what? I'm drunk" (uh-huh)
It's the freakin' weekend (yeah)
Baby, I'm about to have me some fun (c'mon)

Girl, we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Strokin' 'round and 'round
To the remix
We just thuggin' it out
