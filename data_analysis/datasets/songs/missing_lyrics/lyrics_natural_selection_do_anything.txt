Oh yeah

Whatcha gonna do for my love
Just can't
Just can't get
Just can't get enough
Talk to me
Hey I really love you
Love you so so much
Put my lady next to you
To always feel your touch
Every lttle thing you do
Seems to turn me on
Even when youre talking nasty to me
Over the telephone
Honey Ill stay up late for you
And wait for your call
Buzz me up at 5 AM
And I dont mind at all
Cuz Ill do anything for your loving
Yes will Ill do anything But with a serious step are you qualified?
Just can't
Just can't get
Just can't get enough
Talk to me
First thing in the morning
Ill be at your door
O tough
All day long and
All night strong
Just can't get enough
Honey if you let me start you up
We can begin
I play your game
Everytime
Baby won't you let me win
Cuz Ill do anything for your loving
Do anything for your loving or would you send me off like a third class lover
Do anything for your loving til the break of dawn Do anything for your loving baby on
Just can't
Just can't get
Just can't get enough
Talk to me
You got to know
The way I feel
Is for real
Its everlasting

And Ill take heed
And lead you in the right direction for affection
See what Im saying

Stop delayin girl
And make me yor natural selection
Ha ha ha ha
Youre crazy
I dont know about you
But I think I like you
Do anything for your lovin
Could you find the time to make me yours?
Take me out and rock the floors?
GIve me every little bit of your loves what I said
Make it smooth to the groove
Like sandwich bread
Well its you for me
And me for you
Theres not one thing

Hey Ill do most anything
You and me were meant to swing
Swing

I want to be your baby
Just can't
Just can't get
