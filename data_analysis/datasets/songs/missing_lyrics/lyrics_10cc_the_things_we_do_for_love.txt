{Intro}

Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price

The things we do for love
The things we do for love

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number
And your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down

The things we do for love
The things we do for love

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall
{Bridge}

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree
But disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of

The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love....
