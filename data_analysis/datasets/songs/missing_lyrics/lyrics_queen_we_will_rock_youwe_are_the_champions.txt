Suzy Rock:
Life is what you make it don't get lost in yesterday
Who you are or what you've done will all crumble and fade away at some point I
I know what we've got is forever, I know what we've got is forever
Swoope:
Wake up homie, this is what it feels like
No fake or phony we living up that real life
Real enough to feel right, it's on and on
Everlasting absolute phenomenon
Catch what we on, dreams what we on
Live them out, we are not the cats to sleep on
I know you see us, we caught your attention
Something was different about how we living
You gotta love it, you gotta love it, You gotta love it feel real lost in it
The God above us is that real authentic
You already, you already know what the feeling is
Got no fear of what the ending is
We in the sphere where the winners is, Wake up homie
Sho Baraka:
Wake homie got the winning fam in Carolina
Cali, South Africa, Papua, and China
Come find us, Major cities, Asia minor
Multiply by the droves even when they divide us
We got boniquas, Indians, white and Haitian
We walk to a new drum, they call us rhythm nation
We were dying slowly but now we're really patient
A million trumpets blow, so strong it rocks the pavement
An Underground movement, you swore you saw basement/
Dougie, jerk, prep and even Harlem shaking
We got that living water homie we got nice flows
We multiracial with more changes than mikeâ€™s nose
Ya'll just skeletons who be wearing nice clothes
Hockey players who chase ice with no goals
Lost souls they got the dollars and still covet
A bunch of nonsense rappers with big budget
We on our Kobe Grind 24 everyday
Y'all need to be like Michael Jordan and fade away
We Denzeling walking in that blind faith
We unstoppable homie but this can be your training day
What did Queen say we are the champions
And get it started like a Capricorn
Swoope:
Wake up homie, This is what it feels like
No fake or phony we living up that real life
Real enough to feel right, it's on and on
Everlasting absolute phenomenon
Catch what we on, dreams what we on
Live them out, we are not the cats to sleep on
I know you see us, we caught your attention
Something was different about how we living
You gotta love it, you gotta love it, You gotta love it feel real lost in it
The God above us is that real authentic
You already, you already know what the feeling is
Got no fear of what the ending is
We in the sphere where the winners is, Wake up homie
Swoope:
Good is the feeling now, system up in the hood with the windows down
Bumping the life Jason Champion, this is the life made for champions
Peace, 511's with the Louis sneakers
Ring on the left yeah my boo's a keeper
Living cool even though the music's fever
Just a super eager rapper that's cool with features
Super believer in the most high life
Like I blew on the reefer, was a low life
As a U-N believer, got that full life
From the dude that redeems us, I'm cooling with Jesus
Living empty was so-so
But the full life is so sown, I'm cool as a reaper
On that no doze, the fools are the sleepers
Chose just to nod off
Chasing the green blew God off
Chasing their dreams in the streets, got a couple screws loose a few knocked off
Homie they knocked out
Looking for lives key, only they locked out
Homie they locked up
Looking for wifey, only she knocked up
By some other clown, What that mean Swoope?
What they're running down, and searching for gives them the run around
Let me run it down
Pleasure, power, pride, position
Leaves them clowns in prisons of addiction
And that's a nightmare
So I'm cool living my dreams out right here
Suzy Rock:
Life is what you make it don't get lost in yesterday
Who you are or what you've done will all crumble and fade away at some point I
I know what we've got is forever, I know what we've got is forever
So cheers and raise your glasses to this long lasting
Lavish life that was once tragic
A travesty, until the magic happened, tailored made new fresh classic
By the grace that the master crafted, So Classic
New passion so Aloof
Far from the shores I once anchored to pursue
We was once a bunch of fools
With no April to prelude
Past in the rear-view got suitcases
It's a vacation
Catch us Son Bathing
Til our souls brazen
Pushing papers off in Beijing
The good news
So wake up baby please don't snooze
Wake up baby what you gon' do
Propaganda:
Homie, how you figure this even
It's worldwide like the seasons
Amongst those who inherit galaxies
There's no price for membership
And you'd cease to be fooled if
Schooled in God's penmanship
Let's set sail, even when our albums don't
And that's rap past your pay grade
(I'm just giving you a second to catch up)
See the whole  is foolishness
Life by losing it, loving these bruises
Wake up homie
Might be slightly confusing
I don't desire spotlight, I'm trying to be one
That lights up the Kinged one
Unapologetic aggression, call out the uncalled
Wake up your logic is fatally flawed
Three hundred-thousand dollar cars
Parked out in front of Mom's crib
Your Prada kills fathers
And you proud of what you did
Slightly uncomfortable
Palm is openly bragadocious
That's what happens when you got a Pappy
That snatches souls from Sheol
Cute on that pole, but pretty soon she old
You are so cowardly, and hey girl
You got a father that would shower thee with acceptance
Worried about her, well come join the winning circle
Wake up homie. Props moves through to show ya
The soul is so beautiful
On a mountain surrounded by a crown, just clownin'
Wake up homie
Swoope:
Wake up homie, This is what it feels like
No fake or phony we living up that real life
Real enough to feel right, it's on and on
Everlasting absolute phenomenon
Catch what we on, dreams what we on
Live them out, we are not the cats to sleep on
I know you see us, we caught your attention
Something was different about how we living
You gotta love it, you gotta love it, You gotta love it feel real lost in it
The God above us is that real authentic
You already, you already know what the feeling is
Got no fear of what the ending is
We in the sphere where the winners is, Wake up homie
