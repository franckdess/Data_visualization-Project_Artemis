(Two, a-three, a-four)
(Two, a-three, a-four)
I should be saying goodnight
I really shouldn't stay anymore
It's been so long since I held you
Forgotten what love is for
I should run on the double
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) Trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) Yes, I think I'm in trouble
Come, come to me darling and hold me
Let your honey keep you warm
Been so long since I held you
Forgotten what love is for
I should run on the double
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) Trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) Yes, I think I'm in trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
I should run on the double
(I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) Trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
(Oh no, I think I'm in) I think I'm in trouble
