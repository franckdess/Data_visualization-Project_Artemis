I love you, girl
You called me up
And I came to see you
You say you've been awake all night
It hurts me deep inside
When I see you crying
Whatever's wrong
I'll make it right

If you understand how I feel
You should know that my love is real

Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do

Tell me, girl
There were times when I didn't show it
Just how much I care for you
I'm so sorry
Now don't keep saying it's too late
To think it's over, baby
After all that we've been through

Girl, I'm begging you
I'm down on my knees
Don't walk away, baby
Please don't leave me now

Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do

Girl, I know that we can work it out somehow
Isn't that what love is all about
I'm gonna be by your side
We're gonna see it through this time
I won't let you slip away
Say you'll stay with me
Stay with me, girl
'Cause you're the finest girl
That I've ever seen

Tell me
Tell me what you want me to do, baby
My love is only here for you and only you
Tell me what you want me to do
My love is always here for you
So tell me what you want me to do
So tell me what you want me to do
