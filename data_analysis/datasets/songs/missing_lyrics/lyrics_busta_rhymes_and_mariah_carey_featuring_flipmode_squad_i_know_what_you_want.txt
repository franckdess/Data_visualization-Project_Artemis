Yeah
Shawty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out neither
I'mma give it all to you baby
It's burnin' on, bust it

Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short, how much longer can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words
How much the kid loves ya
I'mma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it?
We don't sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
(Listen) I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from looseys and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back (oh yeah)
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats (boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you (give it to me)
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you
I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)
Cause this is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
