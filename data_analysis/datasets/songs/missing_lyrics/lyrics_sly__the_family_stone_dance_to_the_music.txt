Hey Greg

What?

All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat, yeah


I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet


I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide


You might like to hear my organ
I said ‘Ride, Sally, ride’


Cynthia, Jerry
If I could hear the horns blowin'
Cynthia on the throne, yeah


Listen to me
Cynthia & Jerry got a message they're sayin':

All the squares, go home

Aaaaah, yeah


Listen to the voices

Dance to the Music
Dance to the Music
Dance to the Music
Dance to the Music
