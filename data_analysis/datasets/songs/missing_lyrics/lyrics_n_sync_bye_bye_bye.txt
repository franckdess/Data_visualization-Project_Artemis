Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye

I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right, hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more, it ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye, bye, bye

(Bye bye) Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
(Bye bye) Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Just hit me with the truth
Now, girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason baby come on
I live for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more, it ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye, bye, bye

(Bye bye) Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
(Bye bye) Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm giving up I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more
(Bye, bye) I'm checkin' out, I'm signin' off
I don't want to be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leaving you behind
Bye, bye, bye
I don't wanna make it tough
But I've had enough
Bye bye, baby!
And it ain't no lie

(Bye bye) Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
I don't wanna be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
(Bye bye) Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Bye, bye, bye (Bye bye)
