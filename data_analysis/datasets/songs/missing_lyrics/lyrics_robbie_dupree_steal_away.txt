Come on and hold me
Just like you told me
Then show me
What I want to know

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Don't tease me
Why don't you please me
And show me
What you came here for

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Into the night, babe
Baby, tonight
Ooh

I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after
No second chances tonight

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away

Into the night
I know it ain't right
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right
Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away
Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away
