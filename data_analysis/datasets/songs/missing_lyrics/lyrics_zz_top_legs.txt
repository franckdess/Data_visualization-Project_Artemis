She got legs
She knows how to use them
She never begs
She knows how to choose them
She holding leg
Wonder how to feel them
Would you get behind them
If you could only find them?
She's my baby
She's my baby
Yeah, that's alright
Oh, yeah
She's got hair
Down to her fanny
She kinda jet set
Try undo her panties
Every time she's dancing
Sshe knows what to do
Everybody wants to see
If she can use it
She's so fine
She's all mine
Girl, you got it right
Oohh!
She got legs
She knows how to use them
She never begs
She knows how to choose them
She got a dime
All of the time
Stays out at night
Moving through time
Oh, I want her
Shit, I got to have her
The girl is alright
She's alright
Oohh!
