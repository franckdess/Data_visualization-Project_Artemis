Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last
I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definitely needs
(Please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking
At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Yo Bill, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need
(Please be mine)
Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(Baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Levert, or my homey Rob Base
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ
(Have you seen her? Tell me have you seen her? Have you seen her?)
