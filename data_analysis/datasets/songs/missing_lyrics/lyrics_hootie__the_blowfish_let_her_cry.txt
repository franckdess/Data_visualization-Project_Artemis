She sits alone by a lamp post
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind

She never lets me in
Only tell me where's she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away and just

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day
I wanted to look for you
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself
Saying...

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be


Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, oh

Last night I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried
Yelling, "Oh mama, please help me"
Won't you hold my hand and...

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, oh, let her be
