Yeah

Girl, I wish that I could spend time with you each and every day
Prayin', all my love, emotions
That's the things that's got me open
And I don't know what it takes to let you know you're my girl
To let you know you're my baby
And even when then they say we won't stay around
If they only knew that we were meant to be together
Forever and ever, whatever, there's no better thing
Me and you girl, that's why I write you love letters sayin'...

I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend, baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend, baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?

Sometimes I wanna be the one
You be checkin' for, can I get a second for
Me and you to be alone?
Tell me if you think it's wrong
Love is nothin' but the time it takes to say, "I'm on your mind"
Let me tell you, I'm always there, oh, yeah
Let's get a little time away, go to the movies on a Saturday
Meet me at the finish line so I can tell you one more time
Girl, you know I'm not scared to let you say that....

I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend, baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend, baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?

When I think of you
I think of all the things we could do
And I never wanna let you go
And as long as I can let you know
I hope we stay down forever

I like (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I like (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I like (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?

I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend, baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend, baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it?

I like (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I like (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I like (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I like it, girl, don't you know I like it? Yeah
