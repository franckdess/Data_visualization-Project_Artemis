The name of this song is the Wildwood Flower
Now the Wildwood Flower is an old country classic
It's gained a whole new popularity
The song isn't any more popular
But the flower is doin' real good
The wildwood flower grew wild on the farm
And we never knowed what it was called
Some said it was a flower and some said it was a weed
I didn't give it much thought
One day I was out there talking to my brother
And I reached down for a weed to chew on
Things got fuzzy and things got blurry
And then everything was gone!
Didn't know what happened
But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin' burlap
I come to and my brother was there
And he said, "What's wrong with your eyes?"
I said, "I don't know, I was chewing on a weed"
He said, "Let me give it a try"
We spent the rest of that day and most of that night
Trying to find my brother, Bill
Caught up with him, 'bout six o'clock the next morning
Naked, singing on the wind mill!
He said he flew up there
I had to fly up there and bring him down
He was about half crazy
The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds
And put 'em in the sun to dry
Then we mashed 'em up and chopped 'em up
And put 'em in the corncob pipe
Smokin' that wildwood flower got to be a habit
We didn't see no harm
We thought it was kind of handy
Take a trip and never leave the farm!
Big 'ole puff of that wildwood weed next thing you know
You're just wand'ring 'round behind the little animals
All good things gotta come to an end
And it's the same with the wildwood weed
One day this feller from Washington came by
And he spied it and turned white as a sheet
Then they dug and they burned
And they burned and they dug
And they killed all our cute little weeds
Then they drove away
We just smiled and waved
Sittin' there on that sack of seeds!
"Y'all come back now, ya hear?"
