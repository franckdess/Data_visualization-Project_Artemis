I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why
I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star
So many people love you, baby
That must be what you are

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition
I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free

Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star
But I can't love you this much, baby
And love you from this far

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah

Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting (I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting (Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms
Baby, yeah
