I'm stupid, I'm useless
I can't do anything right

Can't show up on time
Even if it would save my life

But according to him
I'm beautiful, incredible
He can't get me out of his head
According to him
I'm funny, irresistible
Everything he ever wanted
Everything is opposite
I don't feel like stopping it
So baby, tell me what I've got to lose
He's into me for everything I'm not
According to you

I'm boring, I'm moody
And you can't take me any place

I suck at telling jokes
'Cause I always give it away

You're the boy who puts up with that

Loved, not hated, oh, no

It's too bad you're making me decide

You're stupid, you're useless
You can't do anything right
