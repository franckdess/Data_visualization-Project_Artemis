I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today ?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago...

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to
