One look in your eyes
And there I see
Just what you mean to me
Here in my heart
I believe
Your love is all I ever need
Holding you close through the night
I need you, yeah
I look in your eyes
And there I see
What happiness really means
The love that we share
Makes life so sweet
Together, we'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And ooh, I need you

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need

When I look in your eyes, there I see
What all that a love should really be
And I need you more, and more each day
Nothing can take your love away
More than a just a dream
I need you

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need

Starting here, ooh
I'm starting now, I believe
Starting here, I'm starting right here
Starting now, right now
I believe in your love
So I'm glad to take the vow

Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need
Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need
