When I'm with you, I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up, my tongue is tied
It's crazy
Can't walk, can't talk
Can't eat, can't sleep
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in deep
'Cause baby

With a kiss, you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa

IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when I look at you, weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when you're next to me, weak from this love
I'm in deep when I look in your eyes
IIII get weak
I get weak!

Romantic eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist
Their power
You know you've got a hold of me
You know you've got me where I want to be
'Cause lover

Like a wave, you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this? I don't know
I just know that there's no way to fight it
Whoa, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa

IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when I look at you, weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when you're next to me, weak from this love
I'm in deep when I look in your eyes
IIII get weak
I get weak!
I get weak!

Just a kiss you can strip me defenseless
Just a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa ohh, whoa ho-ohh

IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when I look at you, weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eye
I I I-I
IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when you're next to me, weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eye
I I I-I
IIIIIIIIIIIIII
Get weak when you're next to me, weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eye
I I I-I
I I I I I
