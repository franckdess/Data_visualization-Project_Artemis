Baby, it was uncool to love me
And then leave me standing here now without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me

I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forever more
I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forever more

Sometimes when I'm alone I feel sad
I know you'll leave me once again, and take my pride
And maybe I am the fool you call me, yeah
'Cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me, yeah

I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forever more
See, I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever, baby (forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forever more

And once again, I'll be right here
Waiting to share your love
But I hope this time for once
We'll forever mean it, oh

See, I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love now, yeah, come and love me forever more
I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever, baby (forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forever more

I, I'm ready, yes, I am
I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever), and ever, baby
Hey love now, come and love me forever more
I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love now, come and love me forever more
I'm ready (I'm ready) to love you forever (forever)
Hey love, come and love me forever more
I'm ready ... to love you ... forever (forever)
Hey love...
