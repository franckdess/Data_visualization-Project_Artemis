We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move
Oh, but you were so shy and so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me...

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

It was the best dang kiss that I'd ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask
For your hand
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band
And I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried when you walked down the aisle
When the preacher man said say I Do
I did, and you did, too
Then I lifted that veil and saw your pretty smile
And I said...

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
Look at all the love that we've got
And it ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not

Yeah baby I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not
