This happened for real
Baby Bash
Yo, Frankie J, obsession

Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin' turning in my bed

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby

Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now, I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm going out of my mind
So baby, if you let me
Kick it witchu, well then maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love

Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
It's an obsession

Hold up, let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' serene
Where my candy, where my cream?
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up, wait a minute
Baby, you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin'
My superfly beauty queen
Imma keep it saucy 'cause my ma know how I do
We go rendezvous
Mi corazon belongs to you

Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
(What am I doing wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
(What am I doing so wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor
