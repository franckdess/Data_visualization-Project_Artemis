I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Yeah, where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, but you never tell
(But you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song
I hope that it will give you hell (Give you hell)
You can sing along
I hope that it puts you through hell
