I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
