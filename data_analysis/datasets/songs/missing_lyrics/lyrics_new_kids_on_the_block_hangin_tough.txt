Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Listen up, everybody, if you wanna take a chance
Just get on the floor and do the New Kids' dance
Don't worry 'bout nothing, 'cause it won't take long
We're gonna put you in a trance with a funky song

'Cause you gotta be hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
Are you tough enough?
Hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
We're rough

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Everybody's always talkin' 'bout who's on top
Don't cross our path, 'cause you're gonna get stomped
We ain't gonna give anybody any slack
And if you try to keep us down, we're gonna come right back

And you know we're hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
Are you tough enough?
Hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
Hangin' tough
We're rough

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Get loose everybody, 'cause we're gonna do our thing
'Cause you know it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
Now check it out

Everybody's hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, just hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hangin' tough
