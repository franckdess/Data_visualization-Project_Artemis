You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy but
You still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I am not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance
No, no, no, no, no, no
I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
If we believe that true love
Never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe (yeah)
Someday you and me will
Find ourselves in love again
Oh baby, yeah
I had a dream
Someday you and me will
Find ourselves in love again
I still believe
(Oh, baby, I do)
Someday you and me
(Just give me one more try) in love again
I had a dream
(I miss your love)
Someday you and me will
Find ourselves in love again
I still believe
(Yeah, I still believe)
Someday you and me (baby)
In love again
