I will love you any way
Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya
Though you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
Woah oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Woah oh sweet thing
Oh you know you're my everything
Yes, you are
I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right
Or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me baby
Don't walk away don't be so shady
Don't want your mind
Don't want your money
These words I say they may sound funny
But
Woah oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Woah oh sweet thing
Boy you know you're my everything
Yes, you are
Yes, you are
You are my heat you are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right
Or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy you
Though you're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're the heat
You are the fire
You're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're the heat
You are the fire
You're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're the heat
You are the fire
You're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
You're the heat
You are the fire
You're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy
