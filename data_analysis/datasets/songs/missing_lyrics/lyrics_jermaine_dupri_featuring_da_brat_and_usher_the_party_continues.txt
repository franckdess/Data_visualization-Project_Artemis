Monday, ten fifty-three A.M

JD, it's me, Bree
Call me, babe
Havin' all them parties, us cats down here think ya'll on vacation, man
Stop doin', man

Come on
See, I been lookin' at the game, ya know?
And I see it ain't too many ya'll
That can make 'em dance like I do
(You say you wanna dance, say you wanna get down?)
The thing what's funny is
Ya'll got the nerve to wanna P.H.D. me
Cuz I'm making all the money
HA HA HA HA HA

While ya'll ride matchbox, I push the hot wheels
Don Chi-Chi with the mass appeal
Lettin' champagne spills on my house in the grill
And all I'm about is the dolla' dolla' bill
Makin' ya' dance every chance I get
And hata's sayin' damn, will he ever catch bricks?
Nah, I don't catch those, keep it ghetto
Stayin' wit' the best hoes, on the east and the west coast
What?

Now, e'where I pass
They wanna see the big booty mamma
Tapping some ass
And whether you believe it or not
You see us, So-So Def make ya'll true believers
My whole entourage keep it top notch
Evidently, we push V's from Bentleys to Drops
Got big things, baby
I'm still greedy to my enemies
I hope you keep on envying me
Yeah, uh

All we wanna do
(Say what, say what?)
Is party
(Uh huh, uh huh)
With you

Who dat?
She the one who love drama?
Keep it heated stay undefeated from the Chi comma Illinois
My crew make more noise than yours
Fifteen a night on tour, make 'em sick with no cure
As she sits by the bar she sips Cristies
In the midst of the party they bump hits by JD
The B.R.A.T., we the element
And you irrelevant
Get down off this shit

I don't pay attention to ya' hatin' and ya' bad looks
Just think about gettin' paper like Garth Brooks
Keep it off the hook
Let the world feel the touch
Ya'll doing too much, sayin' ya oughta see us
It's like this here
I rock the party with Cartier wristwear
In the six, pretty bitches with the long hair
And I got lots of dough, lots in sto'
C. to the E-O

Say you wanna get down, huh?
So whatcha wanna do, huh?
Say you wanna get down, huh?

See I get goosebumps when the baseline thumps
So phat now call me Professor Clump
I ain't gonna front, yeah, I like to floss
And I ain't gotta lie about the girls I toss, you know?

Betta' ask ya' lil' man's where his dough went
Needed mo' rent
We got bent, you know the rest
I split, spent some, lent some to my friends
If you wanna get down, you gotta get in
