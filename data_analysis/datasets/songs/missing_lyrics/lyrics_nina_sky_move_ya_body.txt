Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

All up in the club looking fly
Made your first approach
And caught his eye
Slowly move your way
Towards the dance floor
Grabbed her hand
And she whispered
Hold my hip
Got in the groove
Stand behind me
Let me grind with you
If I lick my lips
I'm probably feeling you
Imma make you go ooh

Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

Whoo
(You feelin' it now)
Take it slow
Turn me on
Club gets warmer
Body moves closer
One with the rhythm
Don't stop moving
You're making me hot
From head to toe
I feel your flow
Vibe gets stronger
Party seems longer
Makes me really want ya
Don't stop moving
You're making me
Hot

Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

Can you feel the beat?
Can you?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart?

Slow wind, slow wind, slow wind, slow wind
Fast wind, fast wind, fast wind, fast wind
Move your body, move your body
Move your body, move your body
