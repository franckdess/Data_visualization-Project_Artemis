Give it your all girl, give it all ya got
You can take a chance, and take your best shot
I see what you want girl, and whatcha do
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you
You're pullin' petals of a flower tryin' to get your way (way)
Keep pullin' 'til it says what you want it to say (say)
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies
But he'd still be my baby
And I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what your thinkin'
You'll be givin' him an open invitation
But my baby won't be taken in
You can pout your cherry lips
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss (sweet kiss)
You can flirt your pretty eyes
He ain't got his hands tied
No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
You're the kinda girl that's always up for do-or-dare (dare)
Only want him just because he's there
Always lookin' for a new ride
The grass is greener on the other side
You're the kinda girl who's not used to hearing no (no)
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go (go)
Doesn't matter how hard you try
Your never gonna get away with my guy
No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got (that's me)
He loves me, he loves you not
No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
Doesn't matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
Give it your all girl, give it all you got
You can take a chance, and take your best shot
Say what you want girl, do what'cha do
He's never gonna make it with you
You can pout your cherry lips
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss (sweet kiss)
You can flirt your pretty eyes (pretty eyes)
He ain't got his hands tied
No chains to unlock (no chains)
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
