Yeah
Can you feel it baby
I can too
Come on swing it
Come on swing it
Come on swing it
Come on swing it
1 - 2 - 3 - now we come to the pay off

It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

Yo it's about that time
To bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme
I'm a get mine so get yours
I wanna see sweat comin' out your pores
On the house tip is how I'm swinging this
Strictly hip hop boy I ain't singing this
Bringing this to the entire nation
Black, white, red, brown
Feel the vibration
Come on come on
Feel it feel it
Feel the vibration

It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

Vibrations good like Sunkist
Many wanna know who done this
Marky Mark and I'm here to move you
Rhymes will groove you
And I'm here to prove to you
That we can party on the positive side
And pump positive vibes
So come along for the ride
Making you feel the rhythm is my occupation
So feel the vibration
Come on come on
Feel it feel it
Feel the vibration

It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation

Donnie D break it down

Donnie D's on the back up
Drug free so put the crack up
No need for speed
I'm anti d-r-u-g-g-i-e my
Body is healthy
And rhymes makes me wealthy
And the funky bunch helps me
To bring you a show with no intoxication
Come on feel the vibration
Yeah
Can you feel it baby
I can too

It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
Now the time has come for you to get up
The rest had you fed up but yo I won't let up
On the rhythm and rhyme thats designed to
Make your behind move to what I'm inclined to
Pure hip hop no sell out
If you ain't in it to win it
Then get the hell out
I command you to dance
I wanna see motivation
Come on now feel the vibration
It's such a good vibration
Come on come on come on
Its such a sweet sensation
Feel it feel it

It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
