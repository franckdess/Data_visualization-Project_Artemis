She was a Jezebel
Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down
So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt
Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
(She was a Jezebel
This bursting queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream)
Telling me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
I just wanna be close to you
(Spinning around like a wheel on fire)
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me
I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
