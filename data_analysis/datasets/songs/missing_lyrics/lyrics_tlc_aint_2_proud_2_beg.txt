Yo, mic check, 1-2, 1-2
We in the house
Yeah, come on
1992, TLC kickin' off in your Mutha...
So ya best be duckin' fast
Yo, T-Boz, is ya being a boss?
Chilli, what's up wit' dat sauce?
Dis is it
Yo "T", step on that (Shhh)
I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge 2 be
Sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone?

I need to feel loved
Why wait 4 so long?
'Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Yo, if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and...
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
So it ain't like I'm braggin', just join the paddywagon, 'cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

Screamin' loud and holdin' sheets
Scared that you'll be called a freak
Gotta let it go while you can
Ain't 2 proud 2 beg, you see
'Cause my man belongs 2 me
And I know that he understands

I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait 4 so long?
'Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Yo, if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (No)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and...

Yo, Left Eye, kick that shit!

Realize the realism of reality treats us both the same
'Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain, it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words, let's refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' da waterbed
Yeah, I like it when you (Mwah!)
Both sets of lips
Oooh, on the TLC tip!

I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (I ain't 2 proud 2 beg)
What I call my own (I ain't 2 proud )
Just you and me (Uh)
Heyyy
I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud to beg

I need to feel loved (I need to feel loved)
Why wait 4 so long?
'Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched (Wanna be touched)
And feeling so much, see, 'cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'
