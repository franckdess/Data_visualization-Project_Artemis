Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Do you really want to know
Just how long love will last?
Will all of the bad times pass?
How can we make things right?
Ooh and why, why is the world so unkind?
We surely can find peace of mind
If we only see the light
Can't you see that?

Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Whoa, here we stand trying not to fall
Oh, there's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Can somebody tell me why
Why do our dreams go wrong?
Why can't we all belong?
Ooh, where did we start?
Oh, and tell me when
When will we ever learn?
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts
Here we are together

Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's too much to bear
Sometimes when life seems to unravel
That's the time oh to say
We're going to make it anyway
Can't you see that?

Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand trying not to fall
There's no need (There's no need to worry)
Love will conquer all

Give love a chance
