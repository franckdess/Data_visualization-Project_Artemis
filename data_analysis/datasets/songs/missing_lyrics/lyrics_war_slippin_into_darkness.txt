I was slippin' into darkness
When they took my friend away
I was slippin' into darkness
When they took, when they took my friend away
You know he loves to drink good whiskey
While Laughing at the moon
Slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
I was slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
Where I talk to my brother
Who never said their name
Slippin' into darkness
All my trouble so I choose
I was slippin' into darkness
All my trouble so I choose
I got a wife and a baby
Now my love hath gained its fame
Slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
I was slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
You've been slippin' into darkness
Pretty soon you gonna pay
