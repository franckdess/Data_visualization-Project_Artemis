Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
Hey, wasn't it me who said
That nothin' good's gonna last forever
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together
Must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand your feelin' that way
Ev'rybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye
In the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die
In the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight
When you're gone, till you go
I need to lie here and
Think about the last time

You'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me
Empty like before
Hey, wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us
Didn't we take each other
To a place where
No one's ever been
Yeah, I really need you
Near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again

Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight
When you're gone
Till you go
I need to hold you until the tie
Your hands reach out and

Touch me in the morning
(Then just walk away)
We're blue and gold
And we could feel one another living
We walked with a dream to hold
And we could take what the world was giving
(We don't have tomorrow)
There's no tomorrow here
There's only love and the time to chase it
(But we had yesterday)
Yesterday's gone my love
There's only now and it's time to face it
