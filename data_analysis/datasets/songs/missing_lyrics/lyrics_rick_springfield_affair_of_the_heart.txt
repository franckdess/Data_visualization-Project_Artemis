Heart in my mouth
Pulse in my head
Mercury rising into the red
The smell of your skin can
Light up all the fires in me
Hungry to touch
I'm eager to please
Out of control
And I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning
To make love to you
But don't try to tell me
You think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that
You ought to know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart
When we make love
It's a passionate thing
You shudder and shake
Sink your teeth in my skin
I almost believe you were made
To be played by my hands
And you got the power
It amazes me still
How you play my emotions
With consummate skill
I don't have to look any further
Than into your eyes
So don't try to tell me
You think it's just physical
It goes way deeper than that
You better know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart
I'm the controller
And I want to touch you and seize you
And make you mine, hey, hey
Don't try to tell me
You think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that
You ought to know
It's an affair of the heart
It's affair of the heart
You better know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
You better know
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart
