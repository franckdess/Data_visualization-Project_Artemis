Wake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes
And the smell of flowers blooming fills the air
Your mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone - that you
Love;
Your life is filled with joy when she is there
Love can make you happy if you fine someone who cares
To give a life time to you and who has a love to share
If you think you've found someone you'll love forevermore
Then it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay)
To have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase
That means the love you've found is going to stay
Love can make you happy if you find someone who cares
To give a life time to you and who has a love to share
La-love, la-love
Love can make you happy
Love can make you happy
Love can make you happy
Love
