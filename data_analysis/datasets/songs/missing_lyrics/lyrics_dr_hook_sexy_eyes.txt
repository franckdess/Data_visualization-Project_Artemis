I was sitting all alone, watching people getting off, with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be
Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
