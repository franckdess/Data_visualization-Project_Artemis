I see you over there so hypnotic
Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'll get you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Gettin' drunk off the thought of you naked
I'll get you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you wanna scream
(Yeah, c'mon)

Kill the lights, shut 'em off, you're electric
Devil eyes tellin' me "Come and get it"
I'll have you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

Girl, tonight you're the prey, I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me whisperin' in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put somethin' on ya

And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you wanna scream

I'mma make you scream loud
Lada, scream, (Usher), lada, scream (If you wanna scream)
Lada, lada, la-lada
Hey, somebody scream Mamma Mia

If you wanna SCREAM

Yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
If you wanna scream
