Early in the morning, I can't sleep
I can't work and I can't eat
I've been drunk all day, can't concentrate
Maybe I'm making a big mistake
Caught me down like a killer shark
It's like a railroad running right through my heart
Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Oh no, not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation

Heartbeats silly like a big bass drum
Losing all equilibrium
It's so hard in the middle of the week
Maybe this woman's just all I need

Oh no, not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Fatuate me, baby

Spirits soar when I'm by her side
She put a little love in this heart of mine
Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm freed
Maybe this woman's just all I need

Oh no, not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Rev it up
