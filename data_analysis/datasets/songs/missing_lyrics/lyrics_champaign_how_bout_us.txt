Ooh, short and sweet
No sense in draggin' on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hangin' on
If the fire's out, we should both be gone
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather
Can't we
Now don't you get me wrong (watcha you saying to me baby)
'Cause I'm not tryin' now to end it all (let's start something new)
It's just that I have seen (what have you seen)
Too many lover's hearts lose their dreams (we won't lose it)
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather
Can't we
How about us, how about us baby (x3)
Are we going to make it girl
Or are we gonna drift and drift and drift together
Ohhhh love
Some people are made for each other
Some people are made for another for life, how 'bout us
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather, tell me, can we
