Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night
Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
(Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night
