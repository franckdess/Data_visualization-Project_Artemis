People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe
My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
My hopes, my dreams come true
My life, I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything
My heart, I can't control
You rule my very soul
My plans, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
But it's only make believe
My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
Just how much I love you so
My only prayer will be
That someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
