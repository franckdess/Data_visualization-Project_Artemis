When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Living without you is driving me crazy
I cry like a baby
Well, I know now that you're not a play thing
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string
As I look back on a love so sweet now
I cry like a baby
Every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby
I know now that you're not a play thing
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string
Today we passed on a street
And you just walked on by
My heart just fell to my feet
And once again I began to cry
When I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Living without you is driving me crazy
I cry like a baby
I know now that you're not a play thing
I cry like a baby
As I look back on a love so sweet now
I cry like a baby
Every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby
My heart just fell to my feet, you know
I cried like a baby
You left the water running now
I cried like a baby
