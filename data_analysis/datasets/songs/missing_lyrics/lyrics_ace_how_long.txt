How long has this been going on?

Well, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

Oh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme

Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day
