I love myself
I want you to love me
When I'm feelin' down
I want you above me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I forget myself
I want you to remind me

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself, ooh
I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

You're the one who makes me come running
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around I'm always laughing
I wanna make you mine

I close my eyes
And see you before me
Think I would die
If you were to ignore me
A fool could see
Just how much I adore you
I get down on my knees
I'd do anything for you

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself, oh-oh
I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no, yeah

I love myself
I want you to love me
When I'm feelin' down
I want you above me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I forget myself
I want you to remind me

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself, oh-oh
I don't want anybody else
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I want you
I don't want anybody else
And when I think about you, I touch myself
Ooh, oooh, oooooh, aaaaaah

I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself, oh-oh
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you, I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I honestly do
I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
I honestly do

I touch myself
I touch myself
I touch myself
