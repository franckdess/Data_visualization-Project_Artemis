We're sick and tired of being left at home
While the boys go out
And leave us all alone, yeah
I wanna go out
With my girlfriends and party all night
And this time
You won't change my mind
'Cause I've got my mind made up
So don't wait up for me
It's the girls nite out
Na, na, night out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's the girls' night to play
Our night to play
So don't wait up for me
We're stepping out
And we're leaving all that troubles behind
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
I've got the girls
And we've only got one thing on our mind
Where are we going tonight?
The time is right
So are you ready to party all night?
And this time
I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I've got my mind made up
So don't wait up for me
It's the girls' nite out
Na, na, night out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's the girls' night to play
Our night to play
So don't wait up for me
I like to party
I'm outta here
Which the time has come
For the boys to realize
That is our turn to have some fun
And it's gonna be tonight
It's the girls nite out
Na, na, night out
And there's nothing you can say, baby
It's the girls' night to play
Our night to play
So don't wait up for me
