Zwei, drei, vier, one, two, three, it's easy to see
But it's not that I don't care, so?
'Cause I hear it all the time but they never let you know
On the TV and the radio, cha!
She was young, her heart was pure
But every night is bright she got
She said sugar is sweet, she come a-rappin' to the beat
Then I knew that she was hot, she was singin'
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
You're in his eye and you'll know why
The more you live, the faster you will die
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?
She said, "Babe, you know, I miss Jill and Joe
And all my funky friends"
But my street understanding was just enough
To know what she really meant
And I got to thinking while she was talking
That I know she told the story
Of those special places that she goes
And when she rides with the others in the subway singing
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
And if he talks to you and you don't know why
You say your life is gonna make you die
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
(Cha, cha)
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
(Cha, cha)
Well, we meet Jill and Joe and brother Herr
With the whole cool gang and all
They're rappin' here, they're rappin' there
And she's climbin' on the wall
It's a clear case, Herr Kommissar
'Cause all the children know
They're all slidin' down into the valley
They're all slipping on the same snow, hear the children
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
He's got the power and you're so weak
And your frustration will not let you speak
La la la la la la
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
And if he talks to you, then you'll know why
The more you live, the faster you will die
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
(Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?)
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh
