We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me
Or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla
Sinking in your fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone always playing
Corporation games
Who cares they're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
Someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
Write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
And we just lost the beat
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Coming through your schools

I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
On another gorgeous sunny Saturday
And I'm seeing that bumper to bumper traffic
Don't you remember? ('Member, 'member)
It's your favorite radio station
In your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks
The city that never sleeps

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio, don't you remember?
We built this city

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city (Oo-ho)
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) We built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
