I've been waitin' to tell you this
You are more than a man could ever want
Wait a minute, just let me look
Listen

Waking up together doing thangs that you wanna
Hatin' on my lady cause you want to be my woman
I ain't gonna stop you, if you do keep on comin'
I'mma play the gat man and just keep on runnin'
Yeah, I got two sons, and a daughter, and a wife
People think I'm living a luxurious life
I'm hollering at you, holler back
Yeah, you wanna slide it back
With a pimp mackin' to your homies, how you did that?

I stepped in the club, in your hood
I slowly turned left, and there you stood
You and your friends talkin'
But when our eyes connect, I knew then
It was just like two ways on beam
I'm your king, be my queen
And whatever you wanna do tonight
My truck is parked out front, so let's ride

I can read your mind, babe
I know what your thinkin
It's alright, it's alriiiiight,yes
So baby take a ride with me
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pouring down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body, that's my goal
So baby, just come down here
Just let the gravity pull you near me


I know you wanna rub, I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel, so baby keep it real
I know you wanna see, I know you wanna be
In my B-E-D, grindin' slowly



Sneakin' in and out of rooms
Every night's a honeymoon
Only Dogg and everything's on the low
I can't talk, I won't talk, even if I could
Now when we do it everybody in your neighborhood
Gon' know about me and I can't be having that girl
See cause my thing is "hush hush" plus I'm 'round the world
I've been with housing girls, Asian girls
A hundred thousand girls, but them Spanish girls
The coldest in the whole world
I smile when you see me in and out your bikini
Naw, I ain't drinking, no, Im'a pass on that Martini
But I have hit of that, pass it hit it, pass it back
Dawg see it's cool, here my girl taking care of that
Matter fact walk with that, y'all could roll with that
See cause I'm rolling up a back, it's too small for the balls
See I'm bossing up and now I'm smoking now
Now if your going with me, let's dip, I'm rollin' out
