She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again
She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question much to my surprise
She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since
She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
She said yes
