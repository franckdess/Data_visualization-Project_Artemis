You fuck boys making to much noise
How u eating rite when ur mothers in debt
You man are bull shitters you don't grime daily
Go get ur cheda hustle for your bread
But you don't make money cah you do make me laugh
When the beef kicks of run to your mummy
Go grab Ur phone phone up ur uncle
Beg for a help then call up ur cuzy
Keyboard warrior internet gangsta
How do u manage to all that talking
That bad boy image ain't gonna back ur arse
I'll take you out and leave u in the past

Kartel Tekmill go ask about me
Iv done so much for my Turks and Kurds
But bitch boys wanna bitch talk about me
I ain't got time for these trolling fucking nerds
Pass me the gloves and pass me the teks
Or pass me the four five let me run up on him
But these pussyholes don't wanna beef with me
Waisting my time on my golden Rolex
Back to my hustle watering plants
Chopping up big buds size of my arms
Day in Day out make money calm
Cash in Pay out spend money fast
Plus we got weapons in a trap yard
Sweets in my pocket i got food in my palm
Mind how taking watch how u walking
Got my pitbulls out ring the alarm
Tek will come to your door
3,8 4,5 bring all of that
Tek mill real fucking gee
24 hour im ready for war
