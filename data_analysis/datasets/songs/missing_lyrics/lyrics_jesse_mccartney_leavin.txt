Hmm...

Hey, baby girl, I've been watching you all day
Man, that thing you got behind you is amazing
You make me wanna take you out and let it rain
I know you got a man, but this is what you should say

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more o' them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Man, she got singin')
She got me singin' like (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now if I talk it, girl, you know that I will walk it out
Man, I'll put my money, money where my mouth is
'Cause you the baddest little thing that I've ever seen
So I'mma ask you one time, if you got a man

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more o' them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Oh, she got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
She got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Girl, you got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left, left, left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
'Cause we gone and we gone and we gone
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl, you deserve nothing but the best
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl, you need to tell him
