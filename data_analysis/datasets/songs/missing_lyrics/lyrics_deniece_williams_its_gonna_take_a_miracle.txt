Loving you so
I was to blind to see
You letting me go
But now that you've set me free
It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
Cause I'm crazy for you
Oh oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy
You lettin' me go
You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
Cause I'm crazy for you
Oh, tho' I know I can't forget about you
I'm gonna try to show how much
You're turning me around, destroying me
I'll never be the same anymore
You must realize
You took your love and left me
Quite by surprise
You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
Cause I'm crazy for you
