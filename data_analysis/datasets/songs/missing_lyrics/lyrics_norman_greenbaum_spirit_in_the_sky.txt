Gonna go to the place that's the best
When I lay me down to die
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die

So you know that when you die
He's gonna recommend you
To the spirit in the sky

You're gonna go to the place that's the best


Never been a sinner, I never sinned

So you know that when I die
He's gonna set me up
With the spirit in the sky

Oh set me up with the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
