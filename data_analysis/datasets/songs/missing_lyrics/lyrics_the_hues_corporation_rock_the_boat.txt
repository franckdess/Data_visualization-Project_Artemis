So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat

Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me
Like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me
Safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place
To harbor you and me
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat

Up to now
We sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips
To keep me warm
Oh, I need to have the strength
That flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear
When love can see me through
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat
Rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat
Rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
Rock the boat
