Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?

My arms are missin' you
My lips feel the same way too
I've tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But this boy keeps comin' around
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down

Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?

He calls me on the phone
About three times a day
No, my heart's not listenin' to
What he has to say
But this loneliness I have within
Keeps reachin' out to be his friend

Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?

Need your lovin'
Need your lovin'

I wanna say
I'm not gettin' any stronger
I can't hold back very much longer
Tryin' hard to be true
But, Jimmy, he talks just as sweet as you

Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?

Need your lovin'
Need your lovin'
I'm not gettin' any stronger (ooh! )
Can't hold back very much longer (ooh! )
Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back?
Need your lovin' (oh, Jimmy Mack)
Need your lovin' (oh, Jimmy Mack)
