Easy lovin', so sexy lookin'
I know from the feelin' that it comes from the heart
Easy lovin', every day's thanksgivin'
To count all my blessings, I wouldn't know where to start
Every time I look you over
So real to life it seems
For upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin', seein's believin'
Life with you's like livin' in a beautiful dream
Every time I look you over
So real to life it seems
For upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin', seein's believin'
Life with you's like livin' in a beautiful dream
