Why be afraid if I'm not alone?
Life is never easy
The rest in unknown
Up to now for me
It's been hands against stone
Each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now
And it's shining on me
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me
Sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
I'll be so much stronger
Holding your hand
Step by step
I'll make it through
I know I can
May not make it easier
But I have felt you near all the way


Ever
I stand on the rock of your love
Ever, ever
Can't nobody stop me
Watch me
Ever and ever
Stand on the rock of your
Love is all it takes
No matter what we face

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now
And it's shining on me
Yes, it's shining on me
I know the love that saved me
You're sharing
You're sharing with me
You're sharing with me
You're sharing with me
You're sharing with me
Cannot be in the dark
Make it into the light, yeah
Your love is shining on me
Shining on me
Shining on me
See the light
I see the light shining
Shining on me
I didn't think that
I could take it
But your love helped me to make it
Coming out of the dark
I see the light now
See the light now
