I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offering
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on at the mall again
"It's all his fault again," that's what you're telling all your friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how your day going I know they stressing on you
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checking on you
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for you
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for you, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
(Oh girl) Come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time
We never had a problem with getting it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one
Now check it I know you get excited (still) when I come around and bite it
(Girl) quit frowning up and quit acting like you don't like it
(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)
(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)
Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
(Oh girl) Come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)

Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time
Long, long time since I seen you
Yes it has, girl
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
(I'm sorry)
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
(Would you believe it?)
Hey, girl, cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
(Oh girl) Come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)

(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)
(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)
Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)
(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)
(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)
Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever
When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever
