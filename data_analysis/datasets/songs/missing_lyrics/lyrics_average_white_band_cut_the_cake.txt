CUT THE CAKE-
Give me a little piece
Let me lick up the cream
CUT THE CAKE-
Well, just a little piece
Baby you know what I mean
CUT THE CAKE-
Give me a little piece
A little lovin' on the side
CUT THE CAKE-
I need a little piece
Just to keep me satisfied
Chorus
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Well it tastes so good don't pass it all around
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
You got to cut it-down!
CUT THE CAKE-
Just a little piece
Of your sweet love
CUT THE CAKE-
Don't you know that I
Can't get enough

Want you to know that I
Ain't a greedy man
CUT THE CAKE-
Don't you know that I'll
Do the best I can

A little lovin' on the side
CUT THE CAKE-

Just to keep me satisfied
