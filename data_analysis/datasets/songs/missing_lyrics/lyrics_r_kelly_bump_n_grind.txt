My mind is telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you (woo)

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
With a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, hey
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, hey, woah, let me hear you

See I know just what you want
And I know just what you need, girl
So baby, bring your body to me (bring your body here)
I'm not fooling around with you, huh
Baby, my love is true (with you)
With you is where I want to be

You need someone
Someone like me, yeah
To satisfy your every need

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, baby, I don't see, woo
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, hey, huh

You say he's not treating you right
Then, lady, spend the night
I'll love you like you need to be love
Girl, won't you try some of me
No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my doors
You'll never feel another love you see
You'll never wanna another love
You'll never find another me

You need someone, someone like me, yeah
To make love to you, baby, constantly

I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
Hey, nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, oh, woah
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, baby, alright
