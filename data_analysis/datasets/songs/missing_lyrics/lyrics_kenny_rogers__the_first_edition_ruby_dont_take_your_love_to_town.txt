{Intro}
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby, for God's sake, turn around
{Outro}
