So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for
Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too
If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away
When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...
Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me
Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, whoa-oh
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were mi-les a-way...
