Aww, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry
Or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl
She fooled me this time
She acted like I was
The last thing on her mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind
As I took those steps
Toward that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would
Make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind
Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
But, ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep looking back but
My baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind
