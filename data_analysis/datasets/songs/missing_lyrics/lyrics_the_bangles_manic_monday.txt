Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made
It's just another manic Monday (oh,oh)
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday
Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there
It's just another manic Monday (oh,oh)
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday
Of all of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
"C'mon honey, let's go make some noise."
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)
It's just another manic Monday (oh, oh)
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday (oh, oh)
I wish it was Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
It's just another manic Monday
