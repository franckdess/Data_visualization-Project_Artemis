Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please


Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
