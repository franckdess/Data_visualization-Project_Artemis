Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through?

Ooh, ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh, ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy
I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?

Ooh, ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh, ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

Sometimes I've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in
But now you've gone away, boy
I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me
I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you, boy
Here today

There was so much you gave me
To my heart, to my soul
There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope
For a brighter day
Why were you my flower
Plucked away

I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Tell me why the road turns
Tell me why the road turns
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
