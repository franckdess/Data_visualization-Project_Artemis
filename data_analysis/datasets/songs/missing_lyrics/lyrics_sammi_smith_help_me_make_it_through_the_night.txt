Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Til the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
Chorus:
I don't care what's right or wrong
I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
But tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
(Repeat Chorus)
