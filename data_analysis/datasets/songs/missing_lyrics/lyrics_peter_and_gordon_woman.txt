Woman, do you love me?
Woman, if you need me then
Believe me I need you
To be my woman
Woman, do you love me?
Woman, if you need me then
Believe me I need you
To be my woman
And should you ask me how I'm doin'
What shall I say? Things are okay
Well, I know that they're not
And I still may have lost you
Woman, do you love me?
Woman, if you need me then
Believe me I need you
To be my woman
I hope you'll take your time and tell me
When we're alone, love will come home
I would give up my world
If you'll say that my girl is my woman
I've got plenty of time
Time just to get through it
Once again you'll be mine
I still think we can do it
And you know how much I love you
Woman, don't forsake me
Woman, if you take me then
Believe me I'll take you
To be my woman
