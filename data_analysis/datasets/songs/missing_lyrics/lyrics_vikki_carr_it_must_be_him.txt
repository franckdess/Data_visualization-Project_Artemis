I tell myself, what's done is done
I tell myself, don't be a fool
Play the field, have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool
I tell myself, don't be a chump
Who cares, let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone, I pray
Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him, it must be him
Or I shall die, or I shall die
Oh hello, hello, my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die, that's when I die
After a while I'm myself again
I pick the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings
And once again I start to pray
Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him, it must be him
Or I shall die, or I shall die
Oh hello, hello, my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die, again I die
Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him, it must be him
Or I shall die, or I shall die
