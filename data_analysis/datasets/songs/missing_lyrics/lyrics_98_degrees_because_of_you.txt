You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all (It's all) It's all because of you

Baby I really know by now
Since we met that day
You showed me the way
I felt it then you gave me love, I can't describe
How much I feel for you
I said baby I should have known by now
Should have been right there whenever you gave me love
And if only you were here
I'd tell you yes I'd tell you (oh yeah)


Honestly, could it be you and me
Like it was before neither less or more
'Cause when I close my eyes at night
I realize that no one else could ever take your place
I still can feel and it's so unreal
When you're touching me, kisses endlessly
It's just a place in the sun where our love's begun
I miss you, yes I miss you baby, oh yeah


If I knew how to tell you what's on my mind
(Make you understand)
Then I'd always be there right by your side


You're my sunshine
You're my sunshine
Oh, yeah
