Sometimes I wonder, by the look in your eye
When I'm standing besides, there's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory
Do you think of someone you hear that special melody?
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)

I often wonder, how it could be
You loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
Rhapsody plays, a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for, the one that I would wait for

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you
Ooo-ooo-ooo
Ohhhhhhhhh-uuuuu

You're my desire
You take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)
