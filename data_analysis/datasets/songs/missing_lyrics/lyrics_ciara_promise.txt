Come enjoy the life
Baby, take a ride
I just wanna vibe with you, you
Baby, you and I can have a good time
Tell me what you like

Now listen, I've been single for a while now
And I've been kinda lonely
But I'm looking for somebody to talk to
Love me, someone who can hold me, is that you?

I'm looking for somebody I can call boo
Looking for the only one that I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?
Make your move
You can be my teacher, I'll do homework
You can give me extra credit, baby, I'll do more work
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you

Make a move
This mood is so right
It feels so right
You can be my prince
My knight
You can be my superman
Save me here I am

Cause baby
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

You and me together - picture perfect
I'll spend all my money all my time because you're worth it
It's just me and you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?
Make a move
Call me Mama, spoil you like a baby
Thinking 'bout you, dreaming 'bout you, got me going crazy
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you

Make a move
This mood is so right
It feels so right
You can be my prince
My knight, whoa
You can be my superman
Save me, here I am

Cause baby
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

Oh, oh
I mean everything that I say
From the bottom of my heart
I will never, never ever hurt you
I open my heart

Open my heart
Give it to you
Tell the whole world that I'm in love with you
Whatever you want
Baby, I'll do
I know I don't want nobody else but you

There's nothing I won't do (There's nothing I won't do, baby)
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you (I will give my all to you)
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

Come on boy and join me, I'll be waitin', waitin', waitin' for you
If you wanna be my homie, I'll be waitin' waitin' waitin' for you
If you wanna be my honey, I'll be waitin' waitin' waitin' for you
Lookin' for my one and only, you can be my one and only
