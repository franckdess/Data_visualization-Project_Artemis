If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow through completely
So won't you give me all I ask for?
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'cause you mean so much to me

Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good (so good)
There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'cause you mean so much to me
'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'cause you mean so much to me

There's a feeling in my heart that I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall, don't let it be too late
There's a time when words are good then they just get in the way
So show me how you feel, baby I'm for real
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'cause you mean so much to me
'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'cause you mean so much to me
