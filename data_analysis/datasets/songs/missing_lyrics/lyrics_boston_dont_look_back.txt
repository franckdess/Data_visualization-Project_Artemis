Don't look back (ooh, a new day is breakin')
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind (ooh, where I get taken)
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes, I will
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
It's a bright horizon (ooh, and I'm awakin' now)
Oh, I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin' (ooh, the clouds are breakin')
'Cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play
I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong, oh, yes, I can
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Ooh, far away and left behind, left behind
Oh, the sun is shinin' and I'm on that road
Don't look back (ooh, a new day is breakin')
Oh, It's been so long since I felt this way
I don't mind (ooh, where I get taken)
The road is callin', today is the day
I can see, it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes, I will
I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Oh, far away and left behind
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
