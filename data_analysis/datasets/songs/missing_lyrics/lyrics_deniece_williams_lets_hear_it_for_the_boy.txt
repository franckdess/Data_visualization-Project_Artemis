My baby, he don't talk sweet
He ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway
And maybe he don't dress fine
But I don't really mind
'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Whooa, whooa, whooa-oh
Let's hear it for the boy

My baby may not be rich
He's watching every dime
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
We always have a real good time
And maybe he sings off-key
But that's all right by me, yeah
'Cause what he does, he does so well
Makes me wanna yell

Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy

'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving one-man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy

Let's hear it for the boy
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for my baby
Let's hear it for my baby
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's hear it for my man
Let's hear it for my man
