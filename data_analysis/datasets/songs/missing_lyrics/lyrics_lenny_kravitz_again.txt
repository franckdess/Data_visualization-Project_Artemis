I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Until you cried, never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?

At every time I've always known
That you were there
Upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you
My love forever

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again?
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
