Take a good look at me
Tell me do you like what you see

Kiss me pretty baby

Girl let your hair down
Take off your clothes and leave on your shoes
Would you mind if I look at you for a moment
Before I make sweet love
Backstage, under age, adolescent
"How ya doin'?" "Fine," she replied
I siiighed, I like to do the wild thing
Action took place
Kinda wet

The time was 6 o'clock on the Swatch watch
No time to chill, got a date
Can't be late

Move to the jacuzzi

Smack it up, flip it, rub it down, oh no...

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me
You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me
