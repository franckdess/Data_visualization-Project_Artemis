Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss

Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing "Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care."

"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Just give me a kiss
