He's free as the breeze
He's always at ease
He lives in the jungle
And hangs by his knees
As he swings through trees
Without a trapeeze
In his BVD's
A-hoo hoo!
He's got a union card
And he's practicin' hard
To play the gitar
Gon' be a big star
Yeah he's gonna go far
An' carry moonbeams home in a jar!
He ordered Chet's guitar course COD
Makes A&E an' he's workin' on B
Digs C&W&R&B an' an' me an' a chimpanzee
Agree that one day soon he'll be
A celebrity
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
OWWWWWWWWW!
Gitarzan!
He's a gitar man!
He's all you can stand
Give him a hand
Gitarzan!
(Tarzan yell)
(Coughing)
He's gotta girl named Jane
With no last name
Kinda homely and plain
But he loves her just the same
'Cause she kindles a flame
And it drives him insane
When he hears her sing
She really does her thing
It's here claim to fame
Come on, sing one Jane:
Baby, baby, Whaooooo Baby!
(Scatting)
Whaooooo Baby!
How 'bout that
Lets here it for Jane!
Thank ya' folks
Well, they gotta pet monkey
He likes to get drunky
And sing boogie woogie
And it sounds real funky
Come on, yo' time, boy
Sing one monkey
Here we go
(Monkey grunts)
Lets here it for the monkey!
Whooooo!
(He He He He)
On Saturday night they need some excitement
Jane gets right and the monkey gets tight
And their voices unite, in the pale moon light
And it sounds alright, yeah, it's dynamite
It's outta sight
Let's hear it, right nnnnnnnnow!
(Gitarzan, Jane, and monkery all together)
Jane:
Shut up baby, I'm tryin' to sing!
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
Owwwwwww!
Gitarzan!
And his jungle band!
They're all you can stand
Give 'em a hand, Gitarzan!
