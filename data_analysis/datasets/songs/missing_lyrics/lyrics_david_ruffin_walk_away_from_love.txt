(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

It's not that I don't love you
You know how much I do
And it's not that I've found someone
To take the place of you
It's just a fear that builds within me
Every time you touch my hand
And a dread that shakes my body
That even I don't understand

So I'm leaving (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart
(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

Ooo, you're clinging to me tighter
Than you ever have before, I don't understand it
But I know it's gonna take everything I've got
To keep walking out the door
But those arms you've got around me
Will let me go some day
And I'd rather leave you holding on
Than pushing me away

So I'm leaving, yes I am (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love, breaks my heart
(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)



Oh baby
It's not that I don't love you (I'm gonna walk away from love
You know how much I do (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
Oh baby (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
I'm leaving baby
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm gonna walk away from love)
Oh, don't break my heart (Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)
I'll walk away baby
