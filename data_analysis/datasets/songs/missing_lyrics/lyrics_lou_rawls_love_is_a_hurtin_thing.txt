For every little kiss, there's a little teardrop
For every single thrill, there's another heartache
The road is rough
The going gets tough

Yes, love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When you're in my arms, I'm a king on a throne
But when we're apart, I walk the streets alone
On one day, happiness
The next day, loneliness

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing

When love brings so much joy, why must it bring such pain?
Guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you
'Cause there may come a time you'll break my heart in two
But I want you so
I want you, though I know that

Love is a hurtin' thing
Oh, love is a hurtin' thing
