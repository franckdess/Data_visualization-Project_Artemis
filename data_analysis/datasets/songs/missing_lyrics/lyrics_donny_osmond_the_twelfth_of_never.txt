You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you, oh, my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you
Till the bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you
Till the clover has lost it's perfume
I'll love you
Till the poets run out of rhyme
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long, long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
That's a long, long time
