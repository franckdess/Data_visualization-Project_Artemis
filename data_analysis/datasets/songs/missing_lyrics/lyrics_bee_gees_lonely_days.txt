Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning, outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

Good morning mister sunshine, you brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman? (Lonely days, lonely nights)
Yeah, lonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman? (Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights (Lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman? (Lonely days, lonely nights)
Yeah, lonely days, (Lonely days,) lonely nights
