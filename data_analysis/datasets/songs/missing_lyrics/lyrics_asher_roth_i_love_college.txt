“Cause I ain't going out like a sucka, no way”
I'm nice right now man
I-I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air?

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
I love college (Hey!)

Now if everybody would please
Put their drink, as high as they can
As high as they can, and repeat after me
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Freshmen! Freshmen!
Freshmen! Freshmen!
Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Keg-stand! Keg-stand!
Keg-stand! Keg-stand!
(That party last night)
Man I love college, I love it
(That party last night)
Goodnight everybody
I gotta head back to class for a little bit

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (You know what's going on)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You are all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college
Do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?

But after that
You know what's goin' down
My house and 3 kegs
See you there, you're all invited
Bring your friends, bring your mom
Do I really have to graduate
Or can I just stay here the rest of my life?
