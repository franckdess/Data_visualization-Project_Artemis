I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, oh no, just because
I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no, no, just because
(There's something about the way she makes me feel)
Ooh, you wait a long time for me
Ooh, you wait a long time
Just because
Ooh, you wait a long time for me
Ooh, you wait a long time
I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lyin' there
But don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, I'm not in love
