Hey, baby

No one else can ever
Joey Crack the Don, Thal√≠a
No one else can ever
TM
No one else can ever
You're just another winner
Woo
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh (hey Rodney)
Terror, come on
Terror Squad!
It's goin' down, baby

What did I
Do to deserve such a man so special in my life?
So many days and nights
I get on the go while I sit and wait for mister right
Baby, then came you
Laidback with your sexy smile
When you move your body you just drive me wild
If you're feelin' me, baby, tell me now
Because I want you, I want you

Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feelin' something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Can't you see
How this love affair would be good for you and me?
'Cause baby, I swear no other man can do
The things that you do when you love me
Oh, baby, you're my lifetime fantasy
So smooth, love the way you walk
I just love to hear when you talk your talk
So if you're feelin' me, baby, let me know
Because I want you, I want you

Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feelin' something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Slow down, love
Don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin' it was
I know you're used to seein' me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin' Cris', just a million in dubs
But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin' us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all
'Cause I don't wanna be a player no more

Baby, no one else
Can ever want you like I do
I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on
Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feelin' something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Baby (baby, baby, baby)
Baby (baby, baby, baby)
