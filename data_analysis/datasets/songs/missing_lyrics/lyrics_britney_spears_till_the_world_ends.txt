Aiii, chimpanzees is hating but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side!
Told you they'd revive your career but somebody lied
I ain't talking poultry when I say "this chicken's fried!"
Anyway Britney, why they so jealous
That you teamed up with me?!
Tell 'em "they my son," yup, gyal dem a mi pickney!
Anyway, brembedell, what's that? I donâ€™t know: Femme Fatale
*Sniff, sniff, cries* I done slayed your whole entire fucking life
Oh, oh, you got some Epsom Salt?
I done balled all day, you ain't touched the court
What, you tired? You need a break?
You was hot when? Ricki Lake!

I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good shit, this is the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

It's Britney, bitch!
I'm Nicki Minaj
And that's Kesha!

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waitin' for?

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Watch me move when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearin', I'm noticin' you starin'
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waitin' for?

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Keep on dancin' till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen

Keep on dancin' till the world ends
World ends, world ends, world ends, world ends
