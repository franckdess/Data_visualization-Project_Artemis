Baby please
Baby please don't take your love from me
I am yours forever more
'till eternity
Silently please, listen to the words I say well
I'm not talking just for play, listen to me please
Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
Heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
Don't you know
There's no need to leave
Heaven knows
I never wanna leave you
Heaven knows
I only wanna please you
Don't you know
Love is what I need
Down inside
Don't get caught with foolish pride
Put all the other things aside
There's only you and me
Believe in us
We were always meant to be
Me for you and you for me
'till eternity
Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
Heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
Don't you know
There's no need to leave
Heaven knows
I only wanna love you
Heaven knows
I never wanna lose you
Don't you know
Love is meant to be
Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
And it's no use now
So stop with the pretending
So come on child, and hear me
When I cry...
