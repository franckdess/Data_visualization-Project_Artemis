I'm your boogie man, that's what I am
I'm here to do whatever I can
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight. It's never too soon
To want to please you, to want to keep you
To want to do it all, all for you
I want to be your, be your rubber ball
I want to be the boy you love most of all, oh yeah
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
I'll do what you want
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
I'll do what you want
I'm your boogie man, that's what I am
I'm here to do whatever I can
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight, oh it's never too soon
To want to take you, to want to hold you
I want to give my all, all to you
And I want you to completely understand
Wherever I'm at and wherever I am, oh yeah
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
I'll do what you want
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
I'll do what you want
I'm your boogie man, that's what I am
I'm here to do whatever I can
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight, oh it's never too soon
I want to be with you, I want to be with you
Can we be together? You and me?
I want to see you, get near you
I want to love you from sundown to sunup
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm your boogie man, that's what I am
I'm here to do whatever I can
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight. It's never too soon
To want to please you, to want to hold you
To want to do it all, all for you
I want to be your, be your rubber ball
I want to be the boy you love most of all
I'm your boogie man, uh-huh
I'm your boogie man, uh-huh
I'm your boogie man, uh-huh
I'm your boogie man, uh-huh
