My heart
These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration (But it's not coming easily)

Tryna find the magic
Tryna write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see ya later

These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own
From my heart flow (From my heart flow)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you
These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way (There's no other way)
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

I'm gettin' off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul expos√©
Whoa, oh
Whoa

Tryna find the magic
Tryna write a classic
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own (These words are my own)
From my heart flow (Don't you know?)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you
These words are my own
From my heart flow (They are from my heart, yeah)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

These words are my own
They're from my heart (My heart)
I love you, I love you
That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say
I love you, is that okay?
