The stars say you're my best lover
Matched up like sugar for a cake
They say our love could conquer anything
I'd always hide my feelings
Keep them so cool and so contained
This time, it's something I just can't retain

'Cause you give me a good vibe, don't you know, baby?
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream?

Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?

Your voice it calls me everywhere
It haunts my room most every night
This thing has sure enough got me on the line
No chance for explanation
It seems my heart has led the way
Is this my chance to find mon amour parfait?

'Cause you give me a good vibe, don't you know, baby
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream?

Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Love can be so misleading

I'd cross the Earth, both land and sea
When I feel that moment badgering me
Could be it's just illusion
But I'm feeling something good indeed
Is this where loving starts to mirror my dreams?

'Cause you give me a good vibe, don't you know, baby?
You give me funky love, funky love
Could this be what love's all about baby
Or is it just another dream?

Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
Is this for real or is it just another dream?
