How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Ohhh... it's a no win situation
How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends
We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we've got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Ohhh... ain't it time we started trying
Ohhh... gotta stop this love from dying
How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
