Lookin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
For SWV to drop a gem on mine
Playa's talk the talk but they can't walk it
We make the whole country bounce when we New York it (say what?)
Don't speak about it, be about it (be about it)
Seein' Puff on your tube, feelin' weak about it (that's right)
I got the skill of an actor (what?), wind chill factor (what?)
Minus five five, coolest man alive (woo)
Baby, who that is? Oh, that's just Puff Daddy
Keep you on my mind, like I keep me on my shine
And I feel fine (yeah)
Sex real time (say what?)
While I'm in your deck on rewind (let's go)
Oh I make it hot, till you're jellin' what PD got (uh huh)
Since PD rock (what?), see me not
So many bricks I build a tenament
We'll do the freaky thing baby girl
If you're into it (let's go)

I'm looking for a lover that
Can make a sacrifice (yeah)
A lover that will understand
Will always be by my side (c'mon)
I pray the Lord so I can find
My Mr. Right
So who can it be
The one for me

Someone that I can believe
Someone to satisfy me
I need love
Ohhh ohh ohh
Someone who's faithful and true
Oh baby, can it be you?
I need love

Oh, can it be that you're the one
And I've been too blind to see
You're everything I'll ever need
Someone will love me for me (that's right)
I wanna know, I wanna see
My destiny
If your love is true
I'll love you too
Cuz I need

Someone that I can believe
Someone to satisfy me
I need love
Ohhh ohh ohh
Someone who's faithful and true

Want you to be mine (want you to be mine)
Baby, why can't you be my everything?

Check this out (I neeeed)
You all know the Steve's, SWV's (uh huh)
Gone for a minute
Chillin' cross seas (that's right)
Back on the scene
Pocket full of cream, now
Gone so long thought they was locked in the Penile
Meanwhile (heh heh heh)
They be bumpin' in the clubs
Can we get freaky tonight, sho' 'nuff
Puff and J-Dub (uh huh)
Platinium stats (yeah), plush oriental rugs, and platinium plaques
Come on

You could be the one
Love of a lifetime
Oh baby, can it be the one for me?
I need to know
Want you to be mine (want you to be mine)
Baby, why can't you be my everything?
I neeeed

Someone that I can believe
Someone to satisfy me
