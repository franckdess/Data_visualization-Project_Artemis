Everybody put your hands together
Whoa, mmm, yeah
Girl, I love you so
112, listen

Girl, if I told you I love you
That doesn't mean it that I don't care, ooh
And when I tell you I need you
Don't you think that I'll never be there, ooh

Baby, I'm so tired of the way you turn
My words into deception and lies
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind
I'm only saying what's in my heart

Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try
Give it a try

Girl, when I ask you to trust me
That doesn't mean it that I'm gonna cheat on you
Cause I'm gonna never do anything to hurt you or mislead you
I love you

Baby, I'm so tired of the way you turn
My words into deception and lies
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind
I'm only saying what's in my heart

Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try
Give it a try

Ain't no doubt about it, Lord knows, I really mean it
I'd rather die before, before I lie to you
Never wanna leave ya, there ain't no life without you
Never gonna leave, never gonna go, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, oh

Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try
Give it a try
Cupid doesn't lie
(Ain't no doubt about it, Lord knows, I really mean it)
But you won't know unless you give it a try
(I'd rather die before, before I lie to you)
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try
Give it a try
Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try
Give it a try
