I gave my heart
And soul to you, girl
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby
Gave you a love
You never knew, girl, whoa
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby
I tried so many times
And that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh
Each time I try
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I (Oh, baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time (Baby)
Didn't I (Listen)
I thought that heart
Of yours was true, girl
Now, didn't I think it, baby
Didn't I think it, baby
But this time
I'm really leavin' you girl, whoa
Hope you know it, baby
Hope you know it, baby
Ten times or more
Yes, I've walk out the door
Get this into your head
There'll be no more
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I (Oh, ho, ho, yeah, yeah)
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby
Ten times or more
Yes, I've walk out the door
Get this into your head
There'll be no more
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I (Oh, baby, baby, baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I (I got to leave you, baby) (Hey, baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I (Oh'oh'oh')
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
