Every man wants a woman
Where him and her can just go hang
Just the two of them alone, kick back
Doing their own thing (Doing their own thing )
And every man wants a woman
That can always keep him in the mood
And I'm that kind of girl
So this is what I tell my dude

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it, just kick it
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it, just kick it

Every man wants a woman
That can cook him up a good meal
A woman he can treat like his homie
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill
Every man wants a woman
That ain't good for just laying on her back
And I'm that kind of woman
So before me and my man get in the sack...

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
This is for the niggas, strictly for the niggas
This is for the niggas, the real niggas
This is for the niggas, strictly for the niggas
This is for the niggas, the real niggas
This is for the niggas, strictly for the niggas
This is for the niggas, the real niggas
This is for the niggas, strictly for the niggas
This is for the niggas,  the real niggas
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the Xscape beat
Just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
