Ladies leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man, he was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to to stop you, you're going off
You got your hair done and your nails done too
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes
And when you're through parlaying at the hottest spot
Tonight you're gonna find the fellas
Rollin' in the Lexus, drops and Hummers
