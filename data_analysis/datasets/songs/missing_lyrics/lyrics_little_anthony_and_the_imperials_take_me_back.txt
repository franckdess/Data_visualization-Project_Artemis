(CHORUS)
Take me back, I'm begging please
Take me back, I'm on my knees
For you to scold me
Hurt me, hold me
Darling, take me back
When you belonged to me
I had a jealous mind
Too late I learned that you
Were not the cheating kind
(CHORUS)
My jealous eyes have learned
To take a look or two
They were too blind to see
That I was losing you
(CHORUS)
They say you live and learn
And though I've tried before
I promise never to
Be jealous any more
(CHORUS)
