Down around the corner
Half a mile from here
You see them long trains runnin'
And you watch 'em disappear
Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love
You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be coming back
Without love
Where would you be right now?
Without love
Well, the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin', mama
'Cause you know they're runnin' late
Without love
Where would you be now-na-na-now?
Without love
Well, the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin', mama
'Cause you know they're runnin' late
Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love
Well, pistons keep on churnin'
And the wheels go 'round and 'round
And the steel rails lie cold and hard
On the mountains they go down
Without love
Where would you be right now?
Without love
Ooh, where would you be now?
Mmm, got to get you, baby baby, won't you move it down?
Won't you move it down?
Baby, baby, baby, baby, won't you move it down?
When the big train run
When the train is movin' on
I got to keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Won't you keep on movin'?
Gonna keep on movin'
