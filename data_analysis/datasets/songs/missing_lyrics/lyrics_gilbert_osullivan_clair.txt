Clair, the moment I met you, I swear
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me, which I couldn't see
And then, the moment I met you, again
I knew in my heart that we were friends
It had to be so, it couldn't be, No
But try as hard as I might do, I don't know why
You get to me in a way I can't describe
Words mean so little when you look up and smile
I don't care what people say
To me you're more than a child
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair, if ever a moment so rare
Was captured for all to compare
That moment is you in all that you do
But why in spite of our age difference do I cry
Each time I leave you I feel I could die
Nothing means more to me than hearing you say
"I'm going to marry you
Will you marry me, Uncle Ray"
Oh, Clair
Clair
Clair, I've told you before "Don't you dare"
"Get back into bed"
"Can't you see that it's late"
"No you can't have a drink"
"Oh, alright then, but wait just a minute"
While I, in an effort to babysit, catch up my breath
What there is left of it
You can be murder at this hour of the day
But in the morning this hour will seem a lifetime away
Oh Clair
Clair
Oh Clair
