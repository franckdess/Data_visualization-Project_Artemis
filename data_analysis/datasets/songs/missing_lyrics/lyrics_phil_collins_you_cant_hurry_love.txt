I need love, love
Ooh, ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine;

My mama said, "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone

I remember mama said, "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"
How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hanging on

I remember mama said, "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes
Now break!

Now love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
Hold me tight
I keep waiting
Ooh, till that day
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
No, you know it ain't easy

My mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take"
