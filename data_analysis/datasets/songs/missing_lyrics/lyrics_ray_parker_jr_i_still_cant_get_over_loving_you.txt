I'm all confused and I don't know what to do
'cause I still can't get over loving you
I've had time but I can't get you off my mind
No
I still can't get over loving you
Ev'ry time I run into your friends
I just have to ask them with who and where you've been
And when they tell me what I really didn't wanna know
It only breaks my heart
Makes me want your love
When I hear your name I get more in save
'cause I still can't get over loving you
I can't turn it loose though I know it's selfabuse
I still can't get over loving you
I've tried to get involved with someone new
But it's just no use 'cause I expect them to be like you
Baby
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'cause ev'ry girl I date resembles you
Oh
Help me
Baby
I'm goin' crazy
I still can't get over loving you
No
It's tearin' my heart apart
'cause I still can't get over loving you
Girl
I'm so sad and if hurts me so bad
Knowin' you're with someone else - someone else
Though I have no right to be
I'm filled with jealousy
'cause I want you for myself
I'm not blaming you
Aw
Baby
It's not your fault
If you don't feel the way I do
And even though I wish that you still loved me
It still won't change the way I feel for you
Girl
I can't forget
It's not over yet:
I still can't get over loving you
Ev'ry breath you take
I'll be watching you
Girl
'cause I still can't get over loving you
Lovin' you
There's no way to this thing's through
No
I still can't get over - not yet
I ain't through loving you. I'm gettin' mad
Girl
Lovin' you
Don't you ever try to leave- no
No - I still can't get over
It'll be the last thing you'll ever do
Lovin' you
I still can't get over loving you
Lovin' you
I still can't get over loving you
