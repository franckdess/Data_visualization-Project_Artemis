Go 'head kiss it, they can't see us inside
Mami tell me do you like - it, I know you like - it
It's written all over your face don't fight - it
You like - it, more than I like - it
So put it all over your face don't bite - it
From rags to riches, club packed with bitches
Had to bag them digits, her head game was vicious (muah)
And we can get it poppin' in the bathroom
Don't be selfish ma, go ahead and pass it to him
Then we can all fuck
It's like a million on my neck, got all of these bitches awestruck

Crack - similar to Mike Jones
Hear my name enough, then I'm takin you home

Three to six women out the club with me
