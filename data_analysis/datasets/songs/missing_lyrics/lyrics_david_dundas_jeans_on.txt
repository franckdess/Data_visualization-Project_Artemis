When I wake up in the morning light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
It's the weekend, and I know that you're free
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me (cha-cha)
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin'
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket
Got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again
I'll meet ya in the usual place
I don't need a thing, 'cept your pretty face
And I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me (cha-cha)
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me (cha-cha)
I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
You and me, we'll go motorbike ridin'
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket
A tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again
When I wake up in the morning light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
I pull my blue jeans on
I pull my old blue jeans on (cha-cha)
