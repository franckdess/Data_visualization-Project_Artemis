Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(ohh I ohh I)

I'm the kind of person
Who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect
Is what I live for
But a look and then
A smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction
Of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking
Using symbols, using words
Can be likened
To a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(ohh I ohh I)

Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a cherry cola
I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(ohh I ohh I)
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(ohh I ohh I)
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(ohh I ohh I)
