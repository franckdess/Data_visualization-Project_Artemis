Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along
Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin "Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that"
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)

Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)
