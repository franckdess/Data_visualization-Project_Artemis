Been thinking 'bout you all night
Guess you got me in your spell
But I think that I'll be allright
Even if I don't get well....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....
I can still remember
What you told me with your eyes
One kiss
Now it's down to this
Guess it's time you realize
Hey, Miss Sun, what could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon
Got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms
Has you back in my arms.....
Hey, Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning
Has you back in my arms
In my arms..... ooh.... ooh.... ah.... ah....ahh
Yeah..... yeah, yeah ,yeah
Hey , Miss Sun
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in my way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....
One kiss is what I need.....
One kiss.... give it to me......
It won't be long until the morning has you......
Won't be long until the morning has you back in my arms......
One kiss....I realize
One kiss....I can see it in your eyes
Oh, it won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms.....
