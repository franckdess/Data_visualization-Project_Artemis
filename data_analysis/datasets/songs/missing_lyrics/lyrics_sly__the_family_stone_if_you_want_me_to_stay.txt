If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
But I am about to go
And then you'll know
For me to stay here I got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person....that you really are now
Got to get in straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman taking up my time
Whoa, oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun (HOW HOW)
When you know that you're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one
Ohh oww oohh
I'll be good
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now

And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person....that you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now
