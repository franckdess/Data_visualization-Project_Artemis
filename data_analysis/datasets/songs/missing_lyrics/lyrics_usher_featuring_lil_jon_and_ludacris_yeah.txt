Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah! Okay
Lil Jon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go!

I was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels (Hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me
I decided to chill (Okay!)
Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!)
Ohh! (Watch out)
She's saying, come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her (Let's go!) I said

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

She's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (Let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey!)
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave
(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
(Hey! Hey! Luda!)

Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)

Let me see you do the A-town stomp!
Do the A-town stomp!
Now do the muscle, do the muscle!
Do the muscle, do the muscle!
A thunder clap, hey! A thunder clap, hey!
A thunder clap, hey! A thunder clap, hey!
Rock a way, rock a way, rock a way, rock a way and cut!
