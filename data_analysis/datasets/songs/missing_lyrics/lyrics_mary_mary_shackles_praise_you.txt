Whew, it sure is hot out here, you know
I don't mind, though
I'm just glad to be free, you know what I'm saying?
Uh...

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
(What you wanna do?)
I just wanna praise You
(Yeah, yeah)
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
(Feel me?)
And I'm gonna praise You
(What you gonna do?)
I'm gonna praise You

In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe
That I can break free
Cause you see I have been bound for so long
Felt like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands
I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
(So I can dance)
I just wanna praise You
(Just wanna praise You)
I just wanna praise You
(Just wanna praise You)
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
(I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gon' lose my mind
Lord, I know You wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need You to lift this load
'Cause I can't take it no more

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
(So I can dance)
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
(yeah)
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
(Oh yeah)
And I'm gonna praise You
(I'm gonna...)
I'm gonna praise You
(I'm gonna praise You)

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
(So I can dance y'all)
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
(I wanna praise You)
I wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
(I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You
(Praise You, praise You)
I'm gonna praise You
(Praise You, yeah)
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
(Yeah, yeah)
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
(I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You
(Praise You)
I'm gonna praise You
(Come on, dance with me)
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Take 'em off, take 'em off
What You gonna do?
Yeah, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Broke all the chains
I'm gonna praise You
What You gonna do?
I'm gonna praise You
