She sits on the dock a fishin' in the water, uh huh
I don't know her name she's the fisherman's daughter, uh huh
Come on down to my boat, baby
Come on down where we can play
Come on down to my boat baby
Come on down, we'll sail away
She smiled so nice like she wants to come with me, uh huh
But she's tied to the dock and she can't get free
Come on down to my boat, baby
Come on down where we can play
Come on down to my boat, baby
Come on down, we'll sail away
Fish all day, sleep all night
Father never lets her out of his sight
Soon I'm gonna have to get my knife and cut that rope (cut that rope)
Then we can go fishin' in my little red boat
Make you happy in my little red boat
So come on down to my boat baby
Come on down where we can play
Come on down to my boat, baby
Come on down, we'll sail away
Come on down to my boat, baby
Come on down where we can play
Come on down to my boat, baby
Come on down we'll sail away
