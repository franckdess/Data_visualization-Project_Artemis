Ooh, yeah yeah, I'm wishin' on a fallin' star
Wonderin' where you are, I wish
Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV
Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place
Till she looked into my eyes
Shook your hand around 9 p.m
And I'm never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shooby-doo-wop and Scooby Snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy, I think I fell for the girl on TV
Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV
Everybody knows her name
They wanna take a picture and they're glad she came
But I just wanna be there when she's down, down
(Be there when she's down)
I don't want her autograph
I just wanna call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shooby doo-wap and Scooby Snacks, I met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheezy, I think, I fell for the girl on TV
Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV
(Wish for you on a falling star)
I'm wishing on a star and I'm wonderin' where you are
(Wondering where you are)
Do I cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
Yeah, so I wish for you on a bright shining star
Every where I look, there you are, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress, she took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for a better day
To the beach shore and Scooby Snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on a movie screen
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams, come on
Wish you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV
Wish for you on a fallin' star, wonderin' where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV
On TV, I wishin', I wishin' away
