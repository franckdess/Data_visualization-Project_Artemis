Now when you're feelin' low and the fish won't bite
You need a little bit o' soul to put you right
You gotta make like you wanna kneel and pray
And then a little bit of soul will come your way
Now when your girl is gone and you're broke in two
You need a little bit o' soul to see you through
And when you raise the roof with your rock'n'roll
You'll get a lot more kicks with a little bit o' soul
And when your party falls 'cause ain't nobody groovin'
A little bit of soul and it really starts movin', yeah
And when you're in a mess and you feel like cryin'
Just remember this little song of mine
And as you go through life tryin' to reach your goal
Just remember what I said about a little bit o'soul
A little bit o' soul, yeah (a little bit o' soul)
A little bit o' soul, yeah (a little bit o' soul)
A little bit o' soul, yeah (a little bit o' soul)
A little bit o' soul, yeah (a little bit o' soul)
