No, don't just walk away
Pretending everything's okay
And you don't care about me
And I know it's just no use
When all your lies become your truths
And I don't care
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now? (Ooh)
Would you tell it to my face?
Or have I been erased?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

You took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate
And you don't care about it, yeah
And I am giving up this game
And leaving you with all the blame
'Cause I don't care

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now? (Ooh)
Would you tell it to my face?
Or have I been erased?
Are you happy now? (Ooh)
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Do you really have everything you want?
You can't ever give something you ain't got
You can't run away from yourself
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now? (Yeah, yeah)

C'mon, tell it to my face
Or have I been replaced?
Are you happy now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Are you happy now?)
Oh, oh
(Are you happy now?) Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Would you look me in the eye?
Could you look me in the eye?
I've had all that I can take
I'm not about to break
'Cause I'm happy now (Ooh)
Are you happy now?
