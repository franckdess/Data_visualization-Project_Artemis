Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Just dancing to the beat
Feel the heat
I'm moving my feet
Heading towards the floor
Gotta get down
Get down some more
Rumba and tango
Latin hustle too
(Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah)
I wanna boogie with you
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Oooh, what a treat
Feels so sweet (Ah)
That body heat
When I'm dancing with my baby
Drives me crazy
Makes me hazy
Rumba and tango
Latin hustle too
(Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah)
I wanna boogie with you
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
