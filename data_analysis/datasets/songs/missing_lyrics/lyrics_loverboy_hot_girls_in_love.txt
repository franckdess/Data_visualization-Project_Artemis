She's so young at heart
She likes the pleasure of his company
She cuts the inside groove
With her silver spoon
She likes her tapes on 10
And it's the same as her anatomy
She's on a rainbow cruise
All the way to my room
She's turnin' on the heat
She's got the magic touch
She's turnin' on the heat
And it's a little too much
She's turnin' on the heat
And it's a hundred above yeah
Hot girls in love
I'm in love
Too many men to please
She counts them all on her rosary
You know you might get burned
So be careful where you touch
She gets it when she can
Don't need no anniversary
And she deserves the best yeah
A cut above the rest
She's turnin' on the heat
She's got the magic touch
She's turnin' on the heat
Ooooh it's a little too much
She's turnin' on the heat
And it's a hundred above
Hot girls in love
And baby I'm in love
Some say she do
Some say she don't
Some say she will
And some say she won't
Some say she can't
Well I know she can
I say I got to be
Her lovin' man
She's turnin' on the heat
She's got the magic touch
She's turnin' on the heat
Ooooh and it's a little too much
She's turnin' on the heat
It's a hundred above
Hot girls in love
Hot girls in love
It's a hundred above
Hot girls in love
Be careful where you touch
'Cause it's a little too much
She got everything she needs
What she does in front of me
She turnin' on the heat
She turnin' on the heat
She got that look in her eye
I think I gotta know why
