Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Hey!
Hey!

I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (huh)
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a, (huh) and a game
And a game (huh)
And a game (huh)
And a game (huh)
A lovegame!

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame
Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
