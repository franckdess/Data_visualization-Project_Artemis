Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Love if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die
If you're not there

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

I feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through
But even if I wanted to I couldn't really truly because my only friend is you
Come on

There are thieves in the temple tonight

Kicking me in my heart, tearing me all apart
(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)
Because me and you could have been a work of art
Thieves in the temple
Baby don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can
Love please help me be
The better man

Better than the thieves in the temple
In the temple tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight
Hurt me

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight

Thieves in the temple

You said you loved me! (Thieves in the temple)
You said I was your friend! (Thieves in the temple)
You were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick) {Thieves in the temple}
You lie! Love come (Lie!) in a hurry (Lie!)

Thieves in the temple
