If I had told her that I loved her
She would have stayed till who knows when
But I guess she couldn't understand it
When I said I wanna be your friend
Because a friend would never doubt you
Or ever put you uptight
And now I wonder what she's doing tonight
Oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight
Oh I wonder what she's doing tonight
We were so close but we should've been closer
And it's making me feel so sad
But I tell myself I didn't lose her
'Cause you can't lose a friend you never had
Because a friend won't say it's over
And got out just for spite
And now I wonder what she's doing tonight
Oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight
Oh I wonder what she's doing to night
Because a friend will always be there
If you're wrong or if you're right
And now I wonder what she's doing tonight
Oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight
Oh I wonder what she's doing tonight
