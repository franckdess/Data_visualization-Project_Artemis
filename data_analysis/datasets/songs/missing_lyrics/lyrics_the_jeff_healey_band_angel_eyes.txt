Girl, you're looking fine tonight
And every guy has got you in his sight
What you're doing with a clown like me
Is surely one of life's little mysteries
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
"How did I ever win your love?"
What did I do?
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
Well, I'm the guy who never learned to dance
Never even got one second glance
Across a crowded room was close enough
I could look but I could never touch
So tonight I'll ask, the stars above
"How did I ever win your love?"
What did I do?
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
Don't anyone wake me
If it's just a dream
'Cause she's the best thing
Ever happened to me
All you fellows
You can look all you like
But this girl you see
She's leavin' here with me tonight
There's just one more thing that I need to know
If this is love why does it scare me so?
It must be somethin' only you can see
'Cause girl I feel it when you look at me
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
"How did I ever win your love?"
What did I do?
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, awww
