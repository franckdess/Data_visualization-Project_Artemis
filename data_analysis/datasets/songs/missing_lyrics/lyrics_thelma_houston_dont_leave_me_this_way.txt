Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way 'cause I can't exist
And I will surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now, come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now, can't you see it's burning out of control?
Come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
(Set me free, baby set me free)

Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand, I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, please don't leave me this way, no, baby
Don't leave me this way, no
I can't survive, I sure can't stay alive
Without your love, baby
Don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So, come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving is gonna set me free
Set me free, set me free (aye, aye)
I need your loving, baby, I need, I need

Satisfy the need in me
Satisfy the need in me
Hey, hey, baby
Come and satisfy the need in me
Oh, woah, baby
Come and satisfy the need in me
Oh, baby, don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
No, don't leave me this way
No, don't leave me this way, baby
Don't leave me
