You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
Oh, oh, I love you

You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
You fell for me too

And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip at all

You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
We're in love, we two
