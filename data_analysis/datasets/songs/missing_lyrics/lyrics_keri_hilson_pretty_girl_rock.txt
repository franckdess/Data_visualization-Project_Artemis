Uh uh uh ah uh uh
I can do the pretty girl rock rock
Rock to the pretty girl rock rock rock
Now, what's your name?

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my deri
Aye, you can stare but if you touch it imma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that is wit ya
I ain't gotta talk about it baby you can see it
But if you want I'll be happy to repeat it

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my deri
Aye, you can stare but if you touch it imma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that is wit ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too then ladies sing it with me

All eyes on me when I walk in,
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

My walk, my talk, the way I dress
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

Aye, now do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock

All my ladies do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock

Now where you at?
If you're looking for me, you can catch me
Cameras flashing, daddy's turned his head as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him?
Owoaah!

Get yourself together, don't hate (don't do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too then ladies sing it with me

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

My walk, my talk, the way I dress
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

Doing the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock

All my ladies do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Get along with your pretty girl rock rock rock
Still show me your pretty girl rock rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock rock
Sing it with me now

All eyes on me when I walk in

Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
