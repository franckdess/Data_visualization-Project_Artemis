Talk to me, baby
I'm listening

Lay down, and tell me what's on your mind
What exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?
Well I will be your comforter, I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light

Come in, I see he's hurt you again
When you are in pain, I'm in pain, that's part of being a friend
But this is a special case, I held my feelings back because of him
And now I can see it more than ever, I made a very big mistake

I don't mean to disregard your feelings, but I think he's a fool
He don't know how sensitive you are, and baby that just ain't cool
I'm just glad I can be there for you, when you need a helping hand
Deep inside my heart from the start, I know I should've been your man

Lay down, and tell me what's on your mind
What exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?
Well I will be your comforter, I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light

I will comfort, comfort, comfort you
I will, I will comfort you
I will comfort, comfort, comfort you
I will, I will comfort you
I will comfort, comfort, comfort you
I will, I will comfort you
I will comfort, comfort, comfort you
I will, I will comfort you

Lay down, and tell me what's on your mind
What exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?
Well I will be your comforter, I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light
