Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You want to keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
Oh how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But when you feel, oh like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Tell me what it is (tell me what it is)
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (look beyond your own)
Try and find another place for me
Cause

At your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know, let me know, let me know
See, at your best baby
