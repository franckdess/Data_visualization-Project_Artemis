You surely must know magic girl
Because you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright
Now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good, girl
And you're all that matters to me
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see, girl
Just knowin' your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin' in on me, girl
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl
And you're all that matters to me
Baby, you're part of every thought I think each day
Your name is in every phrase my lips say
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldn't live without you
Baby (Baby), baby (Baby), baby
You're my everything, you're my everything, yes you are
(You're my everything, girl)
You're the girl I sing about
In every love song I sing
(You're my everything)
You're my winter baby
My summer, my fall and spring
(You're my everything)
Now, now, I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
You're everything good girl and you're all that matters to me
You're my everything, you're my everything, yes you are
(When my way was dark and troubles were near, don't you know baby, that you're my everything)
(Don't you know you're my everything)
You're my everything, you're my everything
(Don't you know you're my everything)
You're my everything, you're my everything
