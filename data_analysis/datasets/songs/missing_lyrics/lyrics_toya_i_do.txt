Aha, Toya, Murphy Lee

Copped some Prada cos I just got paid
I keep the dough, stack the flows like it ain't no thing
And Arista is the label that pays me
Got beats that'll drive ya'll crazy
My shit is fly y'all can plainly see
My hair be tight my nails be right that's why y'all hate on me
But while y'all hating fellas waiting to get in my face
Just take a sip on whatever y'all drinking
Cop a spot on the floor start freaking

Like weight sex, I'm little but packin like safe sex
Sometimes I don't play like a old tape deck
I'm nasty mama, baby tell it all like you're on her
I'm left, right like drama then I pause like karma
Now I'm in the middle like rusher, sex hustler
Doing the right thing to make ya say don't touch ya
