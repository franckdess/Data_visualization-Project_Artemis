Well she's all you'd ever want
She's the kind I'd like to flaunt and take to dinner
Well she always knows her place
She's got style, she's got grace, she's a winner

She's a lady
Whoa whoa whoa
She's a lady
Talkin' about that little lady, and the lady is mine

Well she's never in the way
Always something nice to say, oh what a blessing
I can leave her on her own
Knowing she's okay alone, and there's no messing

She's a lady
Whoa whoa whoa
She's a lady
Talkin' about that little lady, and the lady is mine

Well she never asks for very much and I don't refuse her
Always treat her with respect, I never would abuse her
What she's got is hard to find, and I don't want to lose her
Help me build a mountain from my little pile of clay
Hey, hey, hey

Well she knows what I'm about
She can take what I dish out, and that's not easy
Well she knows me through and through
She knows just what to do, and how to please me

She's a lady
Whoa whoa whoa
She's a lady
Talkin' about the little lady, and the lady is mine
Yeah yeah
She's a lady
Listen to me baby
She's a lady
Whoa whoa whoa
She's a lady
And the lady is mine
Yeah yeah yeah
She's a lady
Talkin' about this little lady
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
She's a lady
She's a lady
I can't live without that little lady
She's a lady
