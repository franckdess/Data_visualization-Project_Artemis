My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And it's a wrap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there)
I'm the truth
And I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it)
Barricades, I run right through 'em
Used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, I'm used to it (It's no use)
You still won't have a pin-up in a fabulous room
On her back, picking out baskets of fruit
I love you, boo
Yeah, Freaky Petey love you too, ha-ha
You know how I do it (That goodie goodie)

You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm looking for
Sexy, independent, gotta spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
If you ain't sexy, independent I ain't wit' it
So you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Tryna hit, but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

So damn hot, but so young
You ain't got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty, you don't play the game (Wait a minute)
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam bam bam (I'm Bad)

You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'!

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh
