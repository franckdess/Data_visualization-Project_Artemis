You want me to leave
You want me to stay
You ask me to come back
You turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers
And you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience
I'm nearing the end
One of these days
You're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on
Has left you behind
Don't wanna be no martyr
You know what to stay
Oh mama baby before it's too late
Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light
So you think I'm a fool
Well you better think twice
I've had enough baby
It's time to realize
You can't have both ways
It's no way to live
You've done all the taking
It's your turn to give
One of these days
You're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on
Has left you behind
Don't wanna be no martyr
You know what to stay
Oh mama baby before it's too late
Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light
Oh, treat me right
You want me to leave
You want me to stay
You ask me to come back
You turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers
And you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience
I'm nearing the end
Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light
Oh treat me right
Treat me right...
