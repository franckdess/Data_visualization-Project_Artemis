While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass a long time ago

Well, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears (Can't do it)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (You were never worth my tears)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years I've sacrificed
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should have left your ass a thousand times

Well, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I deserve better)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(Never gonna shed a tear, no)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna cry no more)
No, I'm not gon' cry (No, no, no, no)
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees (Guarantees)
In love you take your chances (Don't take chances)
But somehow it seems unfair to me (So unfair)
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health, 'til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years I've sacrificed
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should have left your ass a thousand times

Well, I'm not gon' cry (Again, and again, and again)
I'm not gon' cry
(I said I should've been gone, gone, gone, gone)
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry)
It's not the time (It's not worth the time)
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well, I'm not gon' cry
(I'm not gonna shed a tear 'cause you lied)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna cry)
No, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(You were never worth my tears)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (No, I'm not gonna cry)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (All the tears I cried)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time (I'm not gonna shed a tear)
'Cause you're not worth my tears (But you're wrong)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (But you're wrong)
I'm not gon' cry (You're wrong)
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna shed a tear)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
