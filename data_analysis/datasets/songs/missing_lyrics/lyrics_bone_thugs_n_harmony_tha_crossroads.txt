Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Now tell me, what ya gonna do
(Now, tell me what...)
When it ain't nowhere to run
When judgment comes for you
When judgment comes for you?
Now tell me, what ya gonna do
(Now, tell me what...)
When it ain't nowhere to hide
When judgment comes for you
'Cause it's gonna come for you?

Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally
Eazy, C's Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, "well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me."

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won't budge
Grudge, because there's no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo

Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Still we lacin'

Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

Lil Eazy long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dawg?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on

Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely

And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone, long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone, long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody

Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
And I asked the good Lord why
He sighed, he told me we live to die

What's up with that murder, y'all?
See, my little cousin was hung
Somebody really wrong, anybody wanna test us, dawg?
And Ms. Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know while we sinnin'
He intendin' on endin' it when it ends
He comin' again and again and again
Now tell me, what ya gonna do?

Can somebody anybody tell me why, hey
Can somebody anybody tell me why
We die, we die?
I don't wanna die
(Oh so wrong, oh wrong, oh so wrong, oh wrong)

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
