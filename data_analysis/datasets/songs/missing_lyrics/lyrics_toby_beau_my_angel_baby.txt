We've got Troubles
Something's just not right
Just this morning you cried about last night
You said that something's bound to break this time
What's breaking is my heart
I can read between the lines
It's tearing me apart
You've got leaving on your mind
But you're My Angel baby
Yes you're My Angel baby
Wooh you're My Angel baby
For the rest of the night
Do you remember how it used to be?
Loving was easier when you were loving me
I guess you found someone and now I find
What's breaking is my heart
You've got leaving on your mind
