You like to dance
And listen to the music
I like to sing with the band
You like your hands
Splashing in the ocean
Well, I like my feet on the sand

Does anybody have it any better?
Isn't it easy to see
Just how well we fit together

When I start to sing the blues
You pull out my dancing shoes
I think you could be so good for me
You get brave
When I get shy
Just another reason why
I think you could be so good for me
So good

You like to drive
Like Mario Andretti
I like it
Taking my time
But let me say
Wherever you are going
You know it suits me just fine


Could be so good for me
You could be so good
Could be so good
Could be so good for me
You get brave
When I get shy
I know the reason why
You could be so good for
Good for me, baby
Good for me, baby
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby
Oh
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby
You could be so good
Good for me, baby
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby
