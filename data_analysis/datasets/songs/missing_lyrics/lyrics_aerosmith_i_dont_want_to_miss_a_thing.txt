I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever

I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't want to miss a thing

I don't want to miss one smile
I don't want to miss one kiss
Well, I just want to be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just want to hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah!

Don't want to close my eyes
Don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't want to miss a thing

I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't want to miss a thing

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep, yeah
I don't want to miss a thing
