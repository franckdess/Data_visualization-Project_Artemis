Without you, there's no change
My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you
