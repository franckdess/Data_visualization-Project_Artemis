Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
Back to the here and now, oh yeah
Show me how
Decide what you want from me
Tell me maybe I could be there for you

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me, how
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me, how
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
Back to life
Back to the present time
Back from a fantasy, yes
Tell me now, take the initiative
I'll leave it in your hands
Until you're ready

How ever do you need me (x4)
I live at the top of the block
No more room for trouble and fuss
(no no no there's not)
Need a change, a positive change
Look it's me writing on the wall

Oh oh tell me now how do you want me to be, yeah
Back to life back to the day we had
Let's end this foolish game
Hear me out, don't let it waste away
Make up your mind so I know where I stand
