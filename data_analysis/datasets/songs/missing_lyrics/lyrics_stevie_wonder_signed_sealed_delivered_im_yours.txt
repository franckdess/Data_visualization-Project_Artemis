Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am, baby, oh oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
You got my future in your hands, hey hey
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ah hey, yeah yeah
Didn't I? Oh baby

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Ahh, I’m yours!
Ooh wee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am, baby, whoa-oh
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(You got my future in your hands)
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

You got my future in your hands, baby, yeah
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man
But here, I, ahh, with your future, got your future, baby, I, I
Signed, sealed, delivered, I’m yours!
Here I am, baby, ahh
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am, baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
