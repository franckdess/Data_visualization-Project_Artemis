Cashmere Sweater, but K-Mart Headphones
Glass clear weather, but I bled slow
My head's low, zombie walking dead flow
My homies wake out of bed and get stoned
Medicine cabinets, lettuce smoking half of it
Kidney stone masochist has to piss
Spitting with spastic lips to Illmatic clips
While acid trips got him making classic licks
Drunk by the guitar you can call it fender bender
Love letter return to sender, tender
Cheap tricks throw big hits to get you to surrender
80's baby, but 90's crazy make you pretenders
With no brass in pockets, but we crashing rockets
Germans burning Sherman behind Sprockets
Got you feeling live on Saturday night
For now good times, but a sadder might
Ignore the stories of always partying dormitories
There's more to glory than shouts for the forty
Mama should have abort me, I've gone corny
Amy Winehouse dresses back to black to mourn me
As Nas pours a glass of cherry wine
Life is good yes I'm feeling very fine
Cop a bucket of red vines to pass time
Sharp words cause relationships to flat line
Chorus:
Life is good, but it could always be better
Homies keep telling me that I should forget her
Cat and mice, searching for the cheddar
Please king me like your name is Coretta
Verse 2
Please, please king me like checkers
Expressing common woes over dominoes
Looking for a girl down to model clothes
They like Sara Bareilles they bottle souls
Sunny days in funny ways
We found this pot of gold
Where Asher Roth and his honeys blaze
Remind me of this thought of old
Your treasure is where your heart is
I'm just hoping that heaven's not the farthest
Destination, this life test I'm taking
Got me to S.A.T because I don't know how to A.C.T
Maybe Awolnation has embraced A.D.H.D
See me fresh like 88 keys
Babies blaze trees with the baby face steeze
I just don't know where to place these achy knees
In heaven where gods play Sade
I'm just vagabond turned padowan
An Anakin racing past mannequins in a pod race
King me on the throne that I sat upon
Repeat chorus
