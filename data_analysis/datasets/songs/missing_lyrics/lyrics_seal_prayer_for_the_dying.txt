Fearless people
Careless needle
Harsh words spoken
And lives are broken
Forceful aging
Help me, I'm fading
Heaven's waiting
It's time to move on

Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

Just say, "Die," and that would be pessimistic
In your mind, we can walk across water
Please don't cry, it's just a prayer for the dying
I just don't know what's got into me

Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
Life carries on
It goes on

Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
Life carries on
It goes on
It goes on
Goes, goes
Life carries on

When nothing else matters
When nothing else matters
I just don't know what's got into me
It's just a prayer for the dying
For the dying
