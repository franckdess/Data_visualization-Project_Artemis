When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation
Aquarius
Aquarius

When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Let the sunshine (And let the sun shine on in)
Let the sunshine in (Open up your heart)
The sunshine in (Let it shine on in)

Let the sunshine (I want you to sing along with the 5th Dimension)
Let the sunshine in (Hey, open up your heart)
The sunshine in
(Aww, come on)
Let the sunshine (Let it shine)
Let the sunshine in (Everyday)
The sunshine in (Hey, you got to feel it)
Let the sunshine (You got to feel it)
Let the sunshine in (When you open up your heart)
The sunshine in (You gotta let the sun come on in)
(And I see in the mornin')
Let the sunshine (And late at night)
Let the sunshine in (Open up your heart)
The sunshine in (Hey!)
