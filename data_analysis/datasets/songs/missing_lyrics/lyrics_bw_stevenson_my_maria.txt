My Maria
Don't you know I have come a long, long way
I've been longing to see her, when she's around, she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria)
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you
My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my peace of mind
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle worker for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treats me so right, lady, take me away
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria)
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl, oh, my Maria)
Maria (oh, Maria, I love you, girl), I love you
