Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark

The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light e'm up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark

My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)

So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up, light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh, in the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
