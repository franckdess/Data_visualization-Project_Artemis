(Hey!)
Well my temperature's rising and my feet on the floor
Crazy people knocking 'cause they're wanting some more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy, this place is hot

And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
I want, gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin', every day

(Hey!)
Well, my head's a-spinning and I'm floating to sound
Too much is happening 'cause you're not around
It's been a hard day and nothing went too good
I'm gonna relax like-a everybody should
And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
I want you, gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin'
Gimme some-a lovin', everyday

(Hey!)
Well, I feel so good, everything is getting higher
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Better stop baby 'cause I have so much to do
We made it, baby, and it happened to you
And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
(Gimme some a-lovin') every day
(Gimme some a-lovin') every night
(Gimme some a-lovin') Ooh-hoo!
(Gimme some-a lovin') Gimme some a-lovin' every day
(Gimme some a-lovin') Hey, hey, baby
(Gimme some a-lovin') Ooh-hoo
Gimme some a-lovin', oh, every day
Gimme some a-lovin', give your love...
