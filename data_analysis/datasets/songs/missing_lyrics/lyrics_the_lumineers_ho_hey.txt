I been trying to do it right
I been living a lonely life
I been sleepin' here instead
I been sleepin' in my bed
I been sleepin' in my bed
So show me family
All the blood that I will bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart

I don't think you're right for him
Think of what it might have been if we
Took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standin' on Canal, and Bowery
And she'd be standin' next to me

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart

Love we need it now
Let's hope for some
Cause oh, we're bleedin' out

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
