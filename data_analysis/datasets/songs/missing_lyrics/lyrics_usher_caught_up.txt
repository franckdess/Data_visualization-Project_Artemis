I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out, why...

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

Let me go, baby
Now, listen...

My mama told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
Same old song
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
And I can't figure it out, but...

I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

This girl was mean, she really turned me out
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
And now...

I'm so (caught up)
I'm feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (caught up)
I'm so (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me
