What, yeah, uh, here we go
Check, check, uh, uh
Baby, when the lights go out
Yeah, uh, here we go
Check, check
Show you what it's all about
Going at you girl
Know you like this, girl
Uh, here we go

(Check it)
I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way I'm treating you
I never wanted to be so unkind
The only one thing on my mind
Is just kicking it with you, girl

Baby, it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me (you must believe)
Baby, it's not part of the deal
Oh no, no

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out

(Uh, yeah, check it, check it out, second verse, girl)
I know you think it may be just a lie
Ain't no good in putting up a fight
'Cause my heart is set on you
I see the trust is in your eyes
I ain't fooled by your thin disguise
I can see I'm getting through, babe

Girl, don't deny the way you feel
You know you gotta trust me (you gotta trust)
Give me a chance to prove I'm real
Oh yeah, yeah

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out

Uh, it's a blackout, girl, the lights are off
I can feel you gettin' closer, now take your clothes off
Your body looks so soft in between the sheets, I lay you down
Girl, I wanna knock your socks off
Know your flock off, girl, I'm down for whatever
There are few things that's forever
Like you in my life, girl
It's all that I need to get by
Time to break you down 'cause you makin' me high
(Uh, yeah, I like that, know what I mean?)

Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out
Baby, when the lights go out (when the lights go out)
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about (show you what it's all about)
Babe, I swear you will succumb to me (alright)
So, baby, come to me
When the lights go out
Baby, when the lights go out
Every single word could not express
The love and tenderness
