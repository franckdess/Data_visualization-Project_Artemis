 - Verse 1
You know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl I want it just as bad as you do
And look see I can tell from this lil vibe
You got me feeling that you dig me
Boo I'm digging you too
You wanna be one of the chosen few
Then gon jig up in this motherfucker
Maybe me and you can do it big up in this motherfucker
Sit you in a crib where you can chill
Don't have to move a muscle
Give you some be good now you be good
Daddy gon hustle
Come here let me Whisper in your ear
I gotta tell you something
Listening to this song kinda make a nigga want something
Did some daydreaming
Now I'm fiending like I'm on something
Girl don't hold it from me
Cause right now I'll be don strong on ya
I ain't the type to ruin your life
By running game and throwing your dreams
Get in your brain suit your game
Ease your pain and show you things
Sit you on some leather seats while blowing green
And switching lanes
Girl stop playing games let me beat it out the frame

Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
 - Verse 2
She five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds
Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown
Bad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute
Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating

Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
 - Verse 3
Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited til we get to the room
Cuz I've been rocked up since I met you
I'm ready to give you the blues
Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is

Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
