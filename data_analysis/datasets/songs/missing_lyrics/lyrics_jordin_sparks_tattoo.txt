Oh, oh, oh

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I get what I'm askin' for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free, to

Admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)
(I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror
It didn't deliver, It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry, but I gotta be strong
And leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you (I'll always have you)
I'll always have you

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
There's still a part of me in you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do, oh

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken (Yeah, yeah)
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction (Don't look back)
I loved you once, needed protection (No, no)
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
I can't waste time, so give it a moment (I can't waste time)
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done (No need to worry)
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction (Don't you ever look back)
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you
