There's a man at my house, he's so big and strong
He goes to work each day, and he stays all day long
He comes home each night looking tired and beat
He sits down at the dinner table and has a bite to eat
Never a frown always a smile
When he says to me: "How's my child?"
I said that I've been studying hard all day in school
Tryin' very hard to understand the golden rule
I think I'll color this man father
I think I'll color him love
Said I'm gonna color him father
I think I'll color the man love, yes I will
He says education is the thing if you want to compete
Because without it son, life ain't very sweet
I love this man and I don't know why
Except I'll need his strength until the day that I die
My mother loves him and I can tell
By the way she looks at him when he holds my little sister Nell
I heard her say just the other day
That if it hadn't of been for him she couldn't have found her way
I think I'll color him father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I think I'll color this man love
Our real old man he got killed in the war
And she knows she and seven kids couldn't of gotten very far
She said she thought that she could never love again
And then there he stood with that big wide grin
He married my mother and he took us in
And now we belong to the man with that big wide grin
I've got to color this man father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I believe I'll color this man love
He's just been so good to me
I know I've got to color him love
I'm gonna color him father
I've got to color this man love
He's just been so kind
I think I'll color him love
I'm gonna color him father
