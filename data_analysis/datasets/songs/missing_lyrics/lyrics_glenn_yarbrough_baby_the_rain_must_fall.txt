Some men climb a mountain
Some men swim the sea
Some men fly above the sky:
They are what they must be
But, baby the rain must fall
Baby, the wind must blow
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby, I must go, baby I must go
I do not love for silver
I do not love for gold
My heart is mine to give away
It never will be sold
So, baby the rain must fall
Baby, the wind must blow
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby I must go, baby I must go
I am not rich or famous:
But who can ever tell?
I don't know now what waits for me
Maybe heaven, maybe hell
Baby, the rain must fall
Baby, the wind must blow
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby I must go, baby I must go
