I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box
Religion is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know if you know what I mean

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?

I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks
Religion is a light in the fog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

Don't let me get too deep

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or what?
