Is it going? Is it going?
Is it going? Is it going?
I don't know what you're lookin' for
Oh, yeah, boy, come on

I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as it comes if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y-y-y
Seen you try switch it up, but girl, you ain't that dope
I'm the Wonder Woman, let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mami, si mami
Amnesty International, got Bangkok to Montauk on lock
Love my ass and my abs in the video called "Promiscuous"
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous, 'ulous, 'ulous

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A, way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling?
I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top
It's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV
"Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
Now if se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run would never be over, not at least until we say

If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body
(So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)

Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)
Oh... (Huh, huh, huh)

If, you, see, us, in, the...
Club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
If you see us in the club, we'll be actin' real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
Wanna see you work your body (So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me)
