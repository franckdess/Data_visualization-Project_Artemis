The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist

Penny lover, my love's on fire
Penny lover, you're my one desire
Tell me baby could this be true
That I could need someone, like I need you

Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl I surrender
Oh, what more can I do
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay

I don't understand it, oh what's come over me
But I'm not going to worry, no not anymore
Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist

Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)

I remember the first time I saw you baby
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, yeah, yeah
Ooh pretty baby
I just wanted to reachout and touch you baby
I just want to reach out and hold you, I want to reach out and say ooh, ooh
Don't make me cry
I want to talk about you everyday penny lover
Need you, need you baby
