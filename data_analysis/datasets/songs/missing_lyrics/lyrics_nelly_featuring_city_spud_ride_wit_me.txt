Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on, now

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
"So when Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, tell it
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon

Check, check, yo
I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You wonâ€™t believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: "I can't help ya"
"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why, why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, "wishing you was" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all "they wish," come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon
