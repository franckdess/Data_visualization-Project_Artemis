For your love
For your love
For your love
I give you everything and more, and that's for sure
For your love
I bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
For your love

To thrill you with delight, I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love

For your love, for your love
I would give the stars above
For your love, for your love
I would give you all I could

For your love
For your love
For your love
I'd give the moon if it were mine to give
For your love
I'd give the stars and the sun for I live
For your love

To thrill you with delight, I give you diamonds bright
There'll be days that will excite
They'll make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
