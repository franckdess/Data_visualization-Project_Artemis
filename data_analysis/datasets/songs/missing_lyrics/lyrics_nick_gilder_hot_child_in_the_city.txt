{Intro}
Danger in the shape of something wild
Stranger dressed in black she's a hungry child
No-one knows who she is or what her name is
I don't know where she came from or what her game is
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Yeah
Hot child in the city
So young to be loose and on her own
Young boys they all want to take her home
When she comes downtown the boys all stop and stare
When she comes downtown she walks like she just don't care
Yeah
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Yeah
Hot child in the city
{Bridge}
Come on down to my place baby, we'll talk about love
Come on down to my place baby, we'll make love
Hot child in the city. Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city...
