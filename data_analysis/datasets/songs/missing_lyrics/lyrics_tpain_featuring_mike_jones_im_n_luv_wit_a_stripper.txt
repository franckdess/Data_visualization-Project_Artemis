Goddamn, little mama
You know you thick as hell, know what I'm sayin?
Matter fact, after the club, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Me and my niggas gon' be together, you know what I'm sayin'?

I'm just lookin' at you, oh shit, you know
You got them big ass hips, god damn!

Got the body of a goddess
Got eyes butter pecan brown

She comin down from the ceiling (to the flo')
Yeah, she know what she doin' (yea yea yea)
She doin' that right thang (yea yea yea yeah)
I need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl, I'm stayin, I'm in love with a stripper
She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin

She's every man's dream, she's God's gift to Earth
Women they love 'em too, that's what you call a woman's worth
See I love all the strippers, because they show me love
They know I never pay, it's free whenever I hit the club
But I can't even lie, the girls are here so fly
She slidin' up and down that pole, got me mesmerized
Mike Jones don't ever trick, but goddamn she thick
