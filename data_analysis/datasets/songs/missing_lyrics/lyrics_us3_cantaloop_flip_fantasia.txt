Ladies and Gentlemen, as you know we have something special for you at
Birdland this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records
Ah, ah, ah what's that? yeah yeah yeah
Funky funky, how bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute
(ah, ah, ah, what's that? biggity biggity bop)
(yeah, biggity biggity bop, funky, funky)
(ah, ah, ah, what's that? biggity biggity bop)
(yeah, biggity biggity bop, funky, funky)
Jump to the jam boogy woogy jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic masta
Rhyming on the mic and bringing suckas to disasta
Beaucoup ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow birds manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip flip fantasia
(Funky funky, as you know we have something special for you at birdland this evening a recording for Blue Note Records)
Ah, ah, ah, what's that? biggity biggity bop
Yeah, biggity biggity bop, funky, funky
How bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute
How bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute
How bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute
How bout a big hand now?
Wait, wait a minute
(Funky, funky)
Ah, ah, ah, what's that?
Ah, ah, ah, what's that?
