Just watching her blonde hair, sun burn, stare at them
Whitecaps rolling over
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair
Dropping limes in her Corona
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss
Like "Honey, I sure want you"
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'

We got 2-for-1s, we're at a margarita bar
Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads
Just sittin' in the corner laughin'
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar
She smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, she gets 'em going, she gets 'em playing
A little, don't worry be happy

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'

Ah yeah
Lil palm tree leanin'
I got a margerita in my hand, I'm doin' a little drinkin'

Talking 'bout
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin' (Aw, we're just beachin')
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide (Under the palm tree leanin')
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand...
