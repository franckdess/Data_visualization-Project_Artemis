Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to
A MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus
Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO
BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all
Start to twist to the music, including the Bobby

Gear over their uniforms
BASIL EXPOSITION
As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had
Himself frozen in 1967.  Soon after
Austin Powers volunteered to have
Himself frozen, in the event Dr
Evil should ever return.  We believe
Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot
To take over the world.  And that
Gentlemen, is why we're here
COMMAND GILMOUR

With a plate that reads "JOHN
TRAVOLTA."
BORSCHEVSKY
Who is this Austin Powers?  Is he a
British operative?
BASIL EXPOSITION
No, he worked freelance, an
Internationally renowned swinging
Photographer by day and the ultimate
Gentlemen spy by night
Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His
Hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face
Suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His
Glasses are frosted over.  He is very hairy

Inner monologue?

I hope I didn't say that out loud
Just now
There is an uncomfortable SILENCE
VANESSA
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate
You to the Nineties.  You know, a
Lot's changed since 1967
AUSTIN
Well, as long as people are still
Having promiscuous sex with many
Anonymous partners without protection
While at the same time experimenting
With mind-expanding
Drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a

VANESSA
I went to Oxford and excelled in
Several subjects, but I ended up
Specializing in foreign languages
I wanted to travel -- see the world
In my last year I was accepted into
The M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies
Sector.  I thought I was off on an
Exciting career, but my job was to
Read everything printed in every
Country.  It's very boring.  My whole
Day is spent reading wedding
Announcements in Farsi.  If I do
Well with this case, I finally get
Promoted to field operative...
AUSTIN
That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?

Do I make you horny?

I hope this is part of the unfreezing

AUSTIN
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash;
That's what I do, I swing
VANESSA
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but
Let me be perfectly clear with you
Perhaps to the point of being
Insulting.  I will never have sex
With you, ever.  If you were the
Last man on Earth and I was the last

INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS
DR. EVIL
(face again unseen)
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a
Long time, but I'm back.  It's all
Gone perfectly to plan except for
One small flaw.  Because of a
Technical error, my right arm was
Not frozen.  I was therefore by
Definition only partially frozen
ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty
Eyes darting left and right
MUSTAFA
But my design was perfect!  Your
Autonomic functions were shut down
And even though your arm wasn't
Frozen, the aging was retarded
Therefore your right arm is only
Slightly older than the left
DR. EVIL
Can't you see I'm only half a man?
Look at me, I'm a freak!
He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal
MUSTAFA
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do
Is&emdash;
(holding up tennis
Ball)
--work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze
It for twenty minutes a day.  A few
Months of that and it'll be just as
Strong as the other arm...
DR. EVIL
And look what you've done to Mr
Bigglesworth!
ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH
Who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair
Around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself
MUSTAFA
We could not anticipate feline
Complications due to the reanimation
Process&emdash;
DR. EVIL

Silence!
ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT
Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he
Falls backwards into a pit
MUSTAFA
(blood-curdling scream)
Ahhhhhhhhh!
DR. EVIL
(face unseen)
Let this be a reminder to you all
That this organization will not
Tolerate failure
MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY
ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY
FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS
Scar on his cheek
DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, let's get down to business
More muffled SCREAMS
DR. EVIL
We've got a lot of work to do
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Someone help me!  I'm still alive
Only I'm very badly burned
DR. EVIL
(slightly distracted)
Some of you I know, some of you I'm
Meeting for the first time
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone
Call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a
Lot of pain
DR. EVIL
(very frustrated)
You've all been gathered here to
Form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me
He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
If somebody can open the retrieval
Hatch down here, I could get out
See, I designed this device myself
And...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you
Found me.  Listen, I'm very badly
Burned, so if you could just&emdash;
SFX:  Muffled Gunshot
MUSTAFA (O.S.)

Ow!  You shot me!
DR. EVIL
Right.  Okay.  Moving on
MUSTAFA (O.S.)
(muffled)
You shot me right in the arm!  Why
Did&emdash; SFX:  Muffled Gunshot
Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing
DR. EVIL
Let me go around the table and
Introduce everyone.  Frau

The Salvation Army.  Random Task...
RANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform
DR. EVIL
...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman
Extraordinaire.  Show them what you
Do
He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it.  It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room
DR. EVIL
Thank you, Random Task.  Patty
O'Brien...
PATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes
DR. EVIL
...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark?
Around PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet
DR. EVIL
A superstitious man, he leaves a
Tiny keepsake on every victim he
Kills.  Scotland Yard would love to
Get their hands on that piece of
Evidence
PATTY O'BRIEN
(heavy Irish accent)
Yes, they're always after me lucky
Charms!
Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face
PATTY O'BRIEN
What?  What?  Why does everyone always
Laugh when I say that?  They are
After me lucky charms
They cannot contain their LAUGHTER
PATTY O'BRIEN
(angry)
What?
FRAU FARBISSINA
(through suppressed
Laughter)
It's a television commercial with
This little cartoon Leprechaun who
Is a benevolent imp who is very
Concerned that these children will
Steal his lucky charms which are
Foodstuffs fashioned into various
Shapes&emdash; hearts, moons, clovers
What have you...
(pause)
It's a long story
DR. EVIL
Finally, I come to my number two
Man.  His name:  Number Two
NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch
DR. EVIL
For thirty years, Number Two has run
Virtucon, the legitimate face of my
Evil empire
He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to
Reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted
By various miniature models
NUMBER TWO
Over the last thirty years, Virtucon
Has grown by leaps and bounds.  About
Fifteen years ago, we changed from
Volatile chemicals to the
Communication industry.  We own cable companies in thirty-eight states...
The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map
NUMBER TWO
...in addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland...
A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland

...Oil refineries in Seattle...
An oil refinery illuminates in Seattle
NUMBER TWO
And a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.
The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago
NUMBER TWO
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors
(holds up plate)
Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
DR. EVIL
Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called blackmail.  The Royal Family of
Britain are the wealthiest landowners In the world.  Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
There is an uncomfortable silence
NUMBER TWO
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair.  He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
DR. EVIL
People have to tell me these things! I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.
(pausing)
OK, no problem.  Here's my second plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a
weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
There is another uncomfortable silence
NUMBER TWO
Umm, that also has already happened
DR. EVIL
Right
(pause)
Oh, hell, let's just do what we always
Do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons
And hold the world hostage
(pause)
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention
That a breakaway Russian Republic
Called Kreplachistan will be
Transferring a nuclear warhead to
The United Nations in a few days
Here's the plan.  We get the warhead
And we hold the world ransom...
(dramatic pause)
...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
There is an uncomfortable pause
NUMBER TWO
Don't you think we should ask for
More than a million dollars?  A
Million dollars isn't that much money
These days
DR. EVIL
All right then...
(dramatic pause)
...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
There is another uncomfortable pause
NUMBER TWO
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion
Dollars a year
DR. EVIL
(pleasantly surprised)
Oh, really?
(slightly irritated)
One-hundred billion dollars
(pause)
OK, make it happen.  Anything else?
FRAU FARBISSINA
Remember when we froze your semen
You said that if it looked like you
Weren't coming back to try and make
You a son so that a part of you would
Live forever?
DR. EVIL
Yes
FRAU FARBISSINA
Well, after a few years, we got sort
Of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you
To meet your son
DR. EVIL
My son?
FRAU FARBISSINA
Yes
(calling out)
Scott!
SCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a
Kurt Cobain T-shirt
SCOTT EVIL
Hi
DR. EVIL
Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr
Evil
(emotional)
I have a son!  I have a son!
Everyone, I have a son!
(gesturing to globe)
Someday, Scott, this will all be
Yours
SCOTT EVIL
I haven't seen you my whole life and
Now you show up and want a
Relationship?  I hate you!

Computer, and a Global Geosynchronous

This
The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various
Dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush
Dental mirror, and cleaning tool
AUSTIN
Let me guess.  The floss is garotte
Wire, the toothpaste contains plastic
Explosives, and the toothbrush is
The detonation device
VANESSA
No, actually.  I don't know how to
Put this really.  Well, there have
Been fabulous advances in the field

VANESSA
You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation.
AUSTIN
So, shall we shag now, or shall we
Shag later?  How do you like to do
It?  Do you like to wash up first?
Top and tails?  A whore's bath?
Personally, before I'm on the job, I
Like to give my undercarriage a bit
Of a how's-your-father

I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to
Get a rise out of you

This isn't mine

AUSTIN
I love Las Vegas, man.  Oh, I forgot

I'm going to use a cover name.  It's
Important that it be a generic name
So that we don't draw attention to
Ourselves
INT.  CASINO
Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table.  Number Two
Is there, complete with eyepatch.  On one side of him is a
Beautiful ITALIAN WOMAN (a la SOPHIA LOREN) in a white dress

He heads to the rest room

AUSTIN
Too right, youth
INT.  BATHROOM STALL
Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing
Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks
Back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it
Around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the
Wire and certain death
AUSTIN
(grunting)
Uh, uh!
INT.  TEXAN'S STALL
The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about
Frantically.  He can hear the
GRUNTING
TEXAN
Hey pardner, just relax, don't force
It!  Use some creative visualization
INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL
Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's
Crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony
PATTY O'BRIEN

Ughhhhh...
Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty
O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it
Hovers above the toilet bowl

He's asleep
MRS. KENSINGTON
You didn't...
INT.  HOTEL SUITE
VANESSA
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the
Couch
In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is     very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of      flowers blocks his naughty bits from view
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I'm proud of you
VANESSA
Why?
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
Because you managed to resist Austin
Power's charms
Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.      Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number      Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts
VANESSA
Well, God knows he tried, but I've
Been rather firm with him, Mummy
You didn't tell me he was so obsessed
With sex.  It's bizarre
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
You can't judge him by modern
Standards.  He's very much a product
Of his times.  In my day he could
Have any woman he wanted
VANESSA
What about his teeth?
SPLIT SCREEN - HOTEL ROOM/MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE
MRS. KENSINGTON
You have to understand, in Britain
In the Sixties you could be a sex
Symbol and still have bad teeth.  It
Didn't matter
VANESSA
I just don't see it
MRS. KENSINGTON
Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in
His charms, it's impossible to get
Out
VANESSA
Did you ever...
MRS. KENSINGTON
Of course not.  I was married to
Your father
VANESSA
Did you ever want to?
MRS. KENSINGTON
Austin is very charming, very
Debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has
A knowledge of fine wines
Sophisticated, a world-renowned

VANESSA
You didn't answer my question, Mum
MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
I know.  Let me just say this: Austin
Was the most loyal and caring friend
I ever had
I will always love him
AUSTIN (V.O.)
Good morning, luv, who are you on

'hey, why don't we run down the hill
And shag us a cow?', and the wise
Old bull replies, 'no, why don't we
Walk down the hill and shag all the

You in a nutshell
AUSTIN
No, this is me in a nutshell
Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell
AUSTIN
Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind
Of nut has such a big nutshell?  How
Did I get into this bloody great big
Nutshell?
Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy
AUSTIN
You're smashed, Vanessa
VANESSA
I am not
AUSTIN
Oh, yes you are
VANESSA
I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm
Always the designated driver
They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at
Her.  There is an awkward silence
She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away
AUSTIN
I can't.  You're drunk
VANESSA
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just
Beginning to see what my Mum was
Talking about
(pause)
What was my mother like back in the
Sixties?  I'm dying to know
AUSTIN
(sentimental)
She was very groovy.  She was so in
Love with your Dad.  If there was
One
Other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and
Treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But
Unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed
Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep
A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a
RED LIGHT FLASHES
Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE
PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane
BASIL EXPOSITION
(on the picture phone)
Hello, Austin, this is Basil
Exposition from British Intelligence
Thank you for confirming the link
Between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find
Out what part Virtucon plays in
Something called Project Vulcan
I'll need you and Vanessa to get on
That immediately
AUSTIN
Right away, Exposition
BASIL EXPOSITION
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure
AUSTIN
She's working on another lead right
Now
BASIL EXPOSITION
Then you'll have to go it alone
Good luck
AUSTIN
Thank you, Basil
BASIL EXPOSITION
Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN
(knowing)
Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
AUSTIN
Oh, yes.  Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION
There's one more thing, Austin
AUSTIN
Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful.
AUSTIN
Thank you.

Opens it
FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT
Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature
Camera/pendant
AUSTIN
(photographing)
Give it to me baby.  Super
We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's
Holdings in a flow-chart fashion
AUSTIN
Pout for me, luv.  Smashing.  Yes!
Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!
One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under
That we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie"
And in CLOSE-UP&emdash; "Project Vulcan."
We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a
Cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core."
AUSTIN
And I'm spent
The front door opens.  It's Alotta
AUSTIN
You seem surprised to see me
ALOTTA
I thought you'd quit while you were
Ahead
AUSTIN
What, and watch all my earnings go...
(smug)
Down the toilet?
ALOTTA
What do you want, Mr...Cunningham
Was it?
AUSTIN
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I
Call you Alotta...
(pause)
Please?
ALOTTA
You may
AUSTIN
Your boss, Number Two, I understand
That cat's involved in big underground
Drills
ALOTTA
Virtucon's main interest is in cable
Television, but they do have a
Subterranean construction division
Yes.  How did you know?
AUSTIN
(smug)
I didn't, baby, you just told me
ALOTTA
It's for the mining industry, Mr
Cunningham.  We can talk about
Business later.  But first, let me
Slip into something more comfortable
AUSTIN
Behave!

Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she
Takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair
Of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto
INT.  JAPANESE BATH
She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on
Her shoulder, and enters the water
ALOTTA
Come in
AUSTIN
I'd rather talk about Number Two
ALOTTA
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?
Come in, and I'll show you everything
You need to know
Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He
Goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over
ALOTTA
May I wash you?
AUSTIN
Groovy
She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his
Wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION
It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."
ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC
SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS
Trousers
ALOTTA
In Japan, men come first and women
Come second
AUSTIN
Or sometimes not at all
ALOTTA
Care for some saki?
AUSTIN
Sak-i it to me!
Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her
Ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation
Pills."  She drops two PILLS into his drink
Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly
Woozy
ALOTTA
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
AUSTIN
Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation
A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin
AUSTIN
(reciting poem)
'Pardon me for being rude, It was
Not me, it was my food
It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down
Below.'
ALOTTA
That's very clever.  Do you know any
Other poems?
AUSTIN
(reciting in a lofty
Tone)
'Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the corner fudge is made
Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
ALOTTA
(genuinely moved)
Thank you, that's beautiful.  To
Your health
AUSTIN
To my health
ALOTTA
Kiss me
They go to kiss.  She notices HIS TERRIBLE TEETH, CLOSE-UP
ALOTTA
Do you mind if I ask you a personal
Question?
AUSTIN
Is it about my teeth?
ALOTTA
Yes
AUSTIN
Damn.  What exactly do you do at
Virtucon?
ALOTTA
I'll tell you all in due time, after
We make love.  But first, tell me
Another poem
AUSTIN
I think it was Wordsworth who penned
This little gem:  'Press the button
Pull the chain, out comes a chocolate
Choo-choo train.'
ALOTTA
Oh, you're very clever.  Let's make

Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen
You have five days to come up with

Austin did some reconnaissance work

In Kent.  Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?
Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face

My God, Austin, what have you done?
AUSTIN
That's not your mother, that's a
Man!
Austin begins tugging on her hair
MRS. EXPOSITION
Owww...my hair!

Get away from my mother!

Austin, have you gone mad?

Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?
BASIL EXPOSIION
Don't worry, mother.  Lie down
Austin, you have a lot of explaining
To do
AUSTIN
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was
A man
BASIL EXPOSITION
Damn it, man!  You're talking about
My mother!
AUSTIN
You must admit, she is rather mannish
No offense, but if that's a woman
It looks like she's been beaten with
An ugly stick
VANESSA
Really, Austin!
AUSTIN
Look at her hands, baby!  Those are
Carpenter's hands
BASIL EXPOSITION
All right, Austin, I think you should
Go
AUSTIN
I think if everyone were honest
They'd confess that the lady looks
Exactly like a man in drag
BASIL EXPOSITION
I'm leaving!

Oh, and Austin?
AUSTIN
Yes, Basil?
BASIL EXPOSITION
Be careful
AUSTIN
Thanks
Basil escorts his mother out

Austin, may I have a word with you?
AUSTIN
Of course, luv
VANESSA
Listen, I know I'm just being
Neurotic, but I can't shake this
Suspicious
Feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I
Don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad
Relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues
You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to
Give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this
Weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry
AUSTIN
Don't be sorry.  You're right to be
Suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged
Her rotten
VANESSA
(stunned)
I can't believe you made love to her
Just like that.  Did you use
Protection?
AUSTIN
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter

No, did you use a condom?

Well they should, filthy beggars

Well, it means something to me.  If
You want us to have a relationship
You've got to be a one-woman man

I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe
I'd be a vet or something, cause I

Hear from you
DR. EVIL
The details of my life are quite
Inconsequential
THERAPIST
That's not true, Doctor.  Please
Tell us about your childhood
GROUP
Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc
DR. EVIL
Very well, where should I begin?  My
Father was a relentlessly self-
Improving boulangerie owner from
Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy
And a penchant for buggery.  My mother
Was a fifteen-year-old French
Prostitute named Chloe with webbed
Feet.  My father would womanize, he
Would drink, he would make outrageous
Claims, like he invented the question
Mark.  Sometimes he would accuse
Chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of
General malaise that only the genius
Possess and the insane lament.  My
Childhood was typical
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make
Meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap
Bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the
Age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the
Age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically
Shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn
Scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical
School.  From there...

FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
Hi Mom!
MRS. HARWIN
Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news.  Your stepfather was run over by a steamroller
BILLY
But mom, since Dad left, Steve's been like a father to me!

Of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa
DR. EVIL
Welcome to my underground lair, Mr
Powers.  Mrs. Kensington's daughter
How lovely.  I believe your name is
Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except
For obvious reasons
VANESSA
I don't understand
DR. EVIL
My hand, dammit!  Look at it!
AUSTIN
What's wrong with your hand?
DR. EVIL
Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a
Little late for that.  I'm a freak!
Look at it, it's been rendered useless
He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually
Normal, just slightly aged
AUSTIN
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking
Your head space

Oh forget it.  As a fellow player on

My God, man, don't you understand?
It won't just be active volcanoes
Inactive ones will erupt as well
Seven-eighths of the Earth's land
Mass will be deluged with hot magma
Tectonic plates will shift, causing
Massive earthquakes.  Imagine no
United Kingdom.  Think of it, no

Scott my boy, come here.  How was
Your day?
SCOTT EVIL
Well, me and a buddy went to the
Video arcade in town and, like, they
Don't speak English right, and so my
Buddy gets into a fight, and he goes
'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't
Speak French or whatever', and the
Other guy goes something in Paris
Talk, and I go 'um, just back off'
And he goes 'get out' and I go 'make
Me'
DR. EVIL
(trying to hide
Contempt)
Fascinating.  What are your plans
For this evening?
SCOTT EVIL
Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good
Tittie movie on Skinemax
DR. EVIL
And that's how you want to live your
Life, is it?
SCOTT EVIL
Yeah.  What?
ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT
DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE
Button labeled "SCOTT."  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away
DR. EVIL
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's
Nemesis, Austin Powers
SCOTT EVIL
Why are you feeding him?  Why don't
You just kill him?
DR. EVIL
In due time
SCOTT EVIL
But what if he escapes?  Why don't
You just shoot him?  What are you
Waiting for?
DR. EVIL
I have a better idea.  I'm going to
Put him in an easily-escapable
Situation involving an overly-
Elaborate and exotic death
SCOTT EVIL
Why don't you just shoot him now?
Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just
Shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done
DR. EVIL
One more peep out of you and you're
Grounded.  Let's begin
A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil
Hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank
DR. EVIL
Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of
Mine are joining us for dinner
They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal
The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts
Them in the dipping mechanism
AUSTIN
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them
To pay?
DR. EVIL
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to
Die.  Even after they pay me the
Money, I'm still going to melt all
The cities of the world with hot
Magma
DR. EVIL
Release the sharks!Mr. Powers, all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads.  I figure  every creature deserves a warm meal.
NUMBER TWO
(clearing his throat nervously)
Dr. Evil?
DR. EVIL
Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting my moment of triumph
NUMBER TWO
It's about the sharks.  Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.  We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape
DR. EVIL
(disappointed)
You know, I have one simple request... and that is to have sharks... with fricking laser beams attached to their heads!
Evidently, my cycloptic colleague informs me... that that can't be done. Can you remind me what I pay you people for?
Honestly, throw me a bone here. What do we have?
NUMBER TWO
Sea bass.
DR. EVIL
Right.
NUMBER TWO
They're mutated sea bass.
DR. EVIL
Really?  Are they ill-tempered?
NUMBER TWO
Absolutely.
DR. EVIL
That's a start.
(to guard)
All right, guard, begin the Unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping
Mechanism.
The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly
Towards the surface of the water
DR. EVIL
Close the tank!
SCOTT EVIL
Aren't you going to watch them?
They'll get away!
DR. EVIL
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
SCOTT EVIL
I have a gun in my room.  Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
DR. EVIL
No Scott.  You just don't get it, do you?
You don't.
It's no hassle.
-Knock knock.
-Who's there?
Let me tell you a little story
about a man named shh!"
Even before you start,
that was a preemptive shh!"
Just know I have a whole bag
of shh" with your name on it.
Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the
Tank
INT.  TANK AREA
Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They
Can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them, and a sea bass jumps by them.
VANESSA
What's your plan?
AUSTIN
First, I plan to soil myself... then I'm going to regroup and come up with a new plan. Any thoughts?
VANESSA
Wait a minute. I always have this with me, just in case.
She pulls out a container of dental floss.
AUSTIN
All right, I get it.  I have bad teeth.
VANESSA
No, Austin. The floss is to swing ourselves onto the ledge.
AUSTIN
All right. Hold on.
Austin takes the container and throws it to an upward pipe. It wraps around like a grappling hook.

AUSTIN
All right, toothpaste!
Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile
The guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the
Open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES
At the guard loudly.  He turns around
AUSTIN
Judo chop!
Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of
Toothpaste into the guard's eyes
GUARD
(screaming, rubbing
His eyes)
My eyes!  My eyes!
Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing
Both ends
AUSTIN
Hold on, Vanessa!
She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety
Right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water
Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared
All over his face
He and Austin STRUGGLE
The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's
Head dangling over the water.  SEA BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head.
VANESSA
(shouting)
Austin, watch out!
Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender.
AUSTIN
Not a good time to lose one's head.
VANESSA
Indeed.
AUSTIN
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
VANESSA
No
AUSTIN
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. He'll never be the head of a major corporation.
VANESSA
OK, that will do.
AUSTIN
OK.
They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

GUY 2
Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not like him to be late for anything.Especially his own stag party.
GUY 3
Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's such a testament to our friend John that
so many of his buddies showed up to honor him.  There's a lot of love in this room.
They cheer and clink their glasses.
A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches.
WAITRESS
Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party.
GUY 1
I'll get it.
Guy 1 is at the phone.
GUY 1
He's dead?
(pause)
Decapitated by an ill-tempered mutated sea bass?
(pause, as he gets sadder)
Yes. OK.
He hangs up and walks back to the table.
GUY 2
What's wrong?  Was that John?  Is he coming late?
GUY 1
John Smith is not coming
GUY 2
Why not?
GUY 1
He was decapitated by  an ill-tempered mutated sea bass.

No
DR. EVIL
What?
NUMBER TWO
Dr. Evil, I've spent turning this two-bit evil empire... into a world-class multinational. I was going to have a cover story in Forbes. But, you, like an idiot, wanted to take over the world...
And you don't realize there is no world anymore. It's only corporations
DR. EVIL
Silence, Number Two!
NUMBER TWO
No. I've had enough of you pushing me around
Number Two takes a chair
NUMBER TWO
Mr. Powers I have a business proposition you might find very interesting
As Austin is approaching...
DR. EVIL
All right. I've had enough
Dr. Evil presses the trapdoor chair button, Number Two falls into the fiery pit
Vanessa gives Alotta a judo chop
VANESSA
Judo chop!
Meanwhile, Dr. Evil runs towards a button in the wall
A timer reading 0:30 is seen
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.)
(on PA)
The complex will self-destruct
Dr. Evil runs to the egg shaped rocket. Austin SHOOTS and misses. The rocket closes (the words CRYOGENIC FREEZING BEGINNING are seen in  the doors) and begins to lift up through          A HOLE IN THE CEILING
AUSTIN
Let's split! Let's go! This place is going to blow!
Austin and Vanessa run out the door

The Big Boy rocket lifts off again

Chaos as explosions go and everyone tries to run away
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.)
(on PA)
The complex will self-destruct
Along the way Austin and Vanessa are met by someone....
GUARD
I brought you your orange sherbert
Austin smiles as he takes the sherbert pot, and Vanessa drags him away
INT.  MAIN CORRIDOR
They jump over the wedged-in cart, to the escape ladder
AUSTIN
Come on, let's go!
They begin to climb
INT.  MAIN CHAMBER
Explosions, debris, the cavern begins to collapse

EXT.  DESERT
VANESSA
This way, Austin
AUSTIN
Come on, baby! It's gonna blow! Let's go. Move it!
Austin and Vanessa run towards the Shaguar, some mooks running after them. Austin jumps doing cartwheels into the car... landing in a way his crotch hits the shift stick. Close-up as he groans in pain - and again, when he changes the transmission to first gear. The Shaguar drives away
INT.  MAIN CHAMBER
The timer gets to zero
STOCK FOOTAGE - DESERT FLOOR - MERCURY TEST SIGHT

Austin is heard offscreen as a hotel at night is shown
INT. HOTEL ROOM
A messy bedroom. Austin and Vanessa are eventually seen cuddling in bed
VANESSA
I love you, Mr. Powers
AUSTIN
And I love you, Mrs. Powers
His now clean teeth shine. Austin's communicator is heard
AUSTIN
That'll be Basil Exposition
VANESSA
Ignore it, Austin. Come back to bed
AUSTIN
Duty calls, baby
Austin grabs the Casio scheduler, brings it to a desk in front of the bed, and opens it - the thing conveniently covering Austin's privates. Basil's face is seen on the screen
BASIL EXPOSITION
Hello Austin.  I hope I'm not interrupting your honeymoon
Vanessa is stretching in the background. She lies down again
AUSTIN
No, not at all, Basil
BASIL EXPOSITION
Did you get that fruit basket I sent you?
Vanessa rises, holding two pineapples in front of her breasts
VANESSA
Yes, we did, Basil, but you sent too much. I'm gonna have to send some to my mother
Austin grabs something in front of him...

AUSTIN
Oh, Don't forget these
Austin hands two melons, which cover Vanessa's... you know
BASIL EXPOSITION
Did you get my other gift?
Vanessa rises, a rack of spice shakers in front of her chest
VANESSA
We did
AUSTIN
Yes, Basil, nice rack
Austin grabs something in the table... a painting of two naked breasts
AUSTIN
But who in the world gave us this drawing? It's bizarre
He lifts the painting in front of Vanessa. She puts it in front of her boobs, and stares
BASIL EXPOSITION
As you know, Dr. Evil has escaped in his rocket... which has disappeared from our tracking system
Vanessa, gift box in her chest, sits besides Austin

AUSTIN
Hold on. Coffee?
VANESSA
Yes, please
Austin runs away, covering his junk with the box
BASIL EXPOSITION
And, Vanessa, by the way, you have been made a full agent
VANESSA
That's fantastic, Basil! Thanks!
AUSTIN (O.S.)
Milk?
VANESSA
Yes, please
Austin, the coffee pot in front of his junk, turns the milk jugs in front of Vanessa's... you know, into the coffee cups
BASIL EXPOSITION
And, Austin, Her Majesty the Queen informs me... that you are to be knighted
AUSTIN
Very shagadelic!
Austin sits in the bed besides Vanessa
BASIL EXPOSITION
The best of luck to both of you!
AUSTIN
Thanks, Basil!
BASIL EXPOSITION
(waving)
Goodbye!
Screen turns off. Vanessa puts a balloon in her mouth
AUSTIN
You know, Vanessa... I'll never forget the first time I saw you
With ellipsis, Vanessa blows the balloon, which grows increasingly phallic in front of Austin's crotch
AUSTIN
You were so incredibly beautiful... so incredibly sexy... I knew I had to have you... right then and there.Did you feel the same way?
She takes the balloon off her mouth
VANESSA
Actually, I couldn't stop staring at your teeth
AUSTIN
Oh
Vanessa releases the balloon, which deflates
Knocking on door
AUSTIN
I ordered some champagne. Come in!

The waiter enters, we only see his feet as he pushes the cart.
VANESSA  (o.s.)
Lovely, Austin
AUSTIN (o.s.)
Right over there's fine. Thank you
Austin and Vanessa are now in bathrobes

VANESSA
Let's go out on the terrace. It's a beautiful night. We can look at the stars.
They kiss. The plate on the cart is opened... it's a shoe.

AUSTIN (o.s.)
Smashing idea, baby. Look at you
Eventually it closes on Random Task's face. He cricks his neck, Austin and Vanessa look. She gasps and runs.
VANESSA
Look out!
Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE
ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR
The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe  has not killed him.  It has just hurt him
AUSTIN
Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to
Have a lump there, you idiot!  Who
Throws a shoe?  You fight like a
Woman
Random Task starts approaching. Austin does a Karate Kid crane stance, and goes for him. It stops as he grabs his throat and starts strangling Austin, pushing him towards the wall.  Vanessa approaches with the 'Swedish-Made, Penis-Enlarger Pump'.
VANESSA
Austin!
She hands him the Pump.
AUSTIN (choking)
Honestly, it's not mine!
VANESSA
No,  use it
Austin attaches the pump to Random Task's crotch, he groans. Austin  pumps , making Random Task uncomfortable and eventually scream. Vanessa hits his over the head with a champagne bottle, and Random Task falls to the ground, smile on his face
Austin pushes Random Task down the hallway on the food cart he came in with (The pump still attached), with a large crash. A scream is heard. Austin slams the door behind him
AUSTIN
Smashing
Vanessa goes to the balcony, Austin follows. Both holding champagne glasses
AUSTIN
Look how beautiful the night sky is
VANESSA
Isn't that the Big Dipper?
AUSTIN
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus. 
VANESSA
Austin...
VANESSA
I've never seen that big star before
AUSTIN
Yeah, what is that?
He stretches out a pocket telescope
