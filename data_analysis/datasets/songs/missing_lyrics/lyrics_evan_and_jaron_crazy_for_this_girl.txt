She rolls the window down
And she talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by
And I don't know why
But she's changed my mind

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

She was the one to hold me
The night the sky fell down
And what was I thinkin' when
The world didn't end?
Why didn't I know what I know now?

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl

Right now (Right now)
Face to face (Face to face)
All my fears (All my fears)
Pushed aside
And right now (Right now)
I'm ready to spend the rest of my life (My life) with you

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl


Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
