I feel the earth
Move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darling, (I can't stand it)
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth
Move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever (you're around)

Ooh, darling, when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that
(My emotions)
Are something I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby
Uh, ah, ah
Uh, ah, ah yeah-heah

I feel the earth
Move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
I feel the earth move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down

I just a-lose control
Down to my very soul
I get uh, hot and cold
All over, all over , all over, all over

I feel the earth
Move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down
I feel the earth move
Under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, uh tumbling down

Uh Tumbling down
Uh Tumbling down
Uh Tumbling down
Tumbling down
