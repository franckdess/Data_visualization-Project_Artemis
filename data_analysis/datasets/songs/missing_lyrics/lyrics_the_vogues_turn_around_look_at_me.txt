There is someone walking behind you
Turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps
Turn around, look at me
There is someone who really needs you
Here's my heart in my hand
Turn around, look at me
(Turn around)
(Look at me)
Understand, understand
That there's someone who'll stand beside you
Turn around, look at me
And there's someone who'll love and guide you
Turn around, look at me
I've waited, but I'll wait forever
For you to come to me
Look at someone who really loves you
(Look at someone)
Yeah, really loves you
Turn around, look at me
Turn around, look at me
