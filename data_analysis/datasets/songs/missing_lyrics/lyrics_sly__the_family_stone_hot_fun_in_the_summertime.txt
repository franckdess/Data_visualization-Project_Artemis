End of the spring and here she comes back
Hi, hi, hi, hi there
Them summer days
Those summer days
That's when I have most of my fun back
High, high, high, high there
Them summer days
Those summer days
I cloud nine when I want to
Out of school, yeah
County fair in the country sun
And everything is cool
Ooh, yeah
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
First of the fall and there she goes back
Bye, bye, bye, bye there
Them summer days
Those summer days
Bop-bop-ba-bop-bop when I want to
Out of school, yeah
County fair in the country sun
And everything is cool
Ooh, yeah
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
Hot fun in the summertime
