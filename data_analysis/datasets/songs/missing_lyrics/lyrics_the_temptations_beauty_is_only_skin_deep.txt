So in love, sad as could be
'Cause her pretty face got the best of me
Suddenly, you came into my life
And gave it meaning and pure delight
Now good looks I've learned to do without
'Cause now I know it's love that only counts

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

Now you speak your words warm and sincere
It lets me know that you love is dear
A pretty face you may not possess
But what I like about you is your tenderness
A pretty face may be some guy's taste
But I'll take lovin' in its place

'Cause I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh yeah, oh baby, oh yeah, oh yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beauty's only skin deep, oh yeah

My friends ask what do I see in you
But it goes deeper than the eye can view
You have a pleasin' personality
And that's an ever lovin' rare quality
Now show me a girl, a girl that's fine
And I'll choose the one with true lovin' every time

Because I know that
Beauty's only skin deep
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I believe that
Beauty's only skin deep
Oh, yeah

So if you're lookin' for a lover (Oh yeah)
Don't judge a book by its cover (Oh yeah)
She may be fine on the outside (Oh yeah)
But so untrue on the inside (Oh yeah)
