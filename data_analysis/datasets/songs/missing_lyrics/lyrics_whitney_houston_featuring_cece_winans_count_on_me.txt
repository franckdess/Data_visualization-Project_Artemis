Chorus:
Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak
I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on...
I can see it's hurting you
I can feel your pain
It's hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if
It's never gonna end
But you'll get through it
Just don't give in cause you can
Chorus:
Count on me (mm) through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end (ah)
When you are weak
I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on...
You can count on me
Oh yes you can (ah)
Oo, I know sometimes it seems as if
We're standing all alone
But we'll get through it
Cuz love won't let us fall
Chorus:
Count on me (count on me, i'll be there) through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak
I will be strong (I'll be strong)
Helping you to carry on (yes, you know)
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on...
Count on...
There's a place inside all of us
Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
The answers' there within, oh
I know that life can make you feel
It's much harder than it really is
But we'll get through it (we'll get through it)
(Just) Just (don't) don't give in (oh)
Chorus:
Count on me (count on me) through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end (it'll never end)
When you are weak (you)
I will be strong (I will be strong)
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid (don't be afraid now)
Please believe me when I say
Count on
Count on
Count on
Count on
Count on
Count on me
Oh yes you can
I know I can
Yes you can
Well
So glad I can, count on me
