No matter what you think you pulled
You'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know
You won't get through
It's a given L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you, you

No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view
Awaits downtown
You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down

Shakedown, breakdown, take down
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, take down
You're busted
Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown, take down
You're busted (oh, oh, uh)

This is a town where everyone
Is reaching for the top
This is a place where
Second best will never do
It's okay you want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you

Shakedown, breakdown, take down
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, take down
You're busted
Shakedown, breakdown, honey
Just about the time you're thinking it's alright
Breakdown, take down
You're busted

Oh, busted
Oh oh

Shakedown (breakdown), breakdown (takedown), takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown (take down), takedown (shakedown)
You're busted (busted)
Shakedown (breakdown), breakdown (take down), honey
Just about the time you're thinking it's alright
Breakdown (take down), takedown (shakedown)
You're busted
Shakedown, breakdown, take down
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, take down
You're busted
Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you're thinking it's alright
Breakdown, take down
Oh, you're busted
Shakedown, breakdown, take down
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, take down
You're busted
Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you're thinking it's alright
