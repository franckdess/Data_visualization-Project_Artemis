Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah
Lately, I gotta watch what I say
'Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh, now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back

And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

Oh oh oh, oh oh, yeah
What happened to the one I used to know? (Oh, yeah, yeah)
The one I used to laugh and joke with?
The one I used to tell all my secrets?
We used to chill and be down for whatever, whenever together, yeah

And my mind's gone half crazy (Oh) 'cause I can't leave you alone (I'm going half crazy, baby)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me (Oh) holdin' on (Over you, yeah)
Said my mind's gone half crazy (Yeah) 'cause I can't leave you alone (And I just don't know)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (I said I just don't know what to do now)
(Listen, we used to chill)
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, we used to hang)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah, we used to do, we used to do some many things together, yeah)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Oh oh, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, uh
