In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searching ain't over...over
I know that

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting somewhere...oh yeah

If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl
Yes I know...I know that

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting somewhere...oh

It's enough to make you cry
When you see her walking by
And you look into her eyes

When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standing by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting somewhere...oh

When you love a woman
When you love, love, love, love
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
