Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me

It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'

She was right thur wit me bottle poppin' livin' that life (livin' that life)
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that ain't life (and that ain't life)

They tell me don't trust the woman in this industry
But, she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me

And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like "damn"

Walked in the house wit hard work, my head hurt
Instead of arguin' can I have dinner wit some dessert? Uhh-uhh
She talkin' bout this phone number she found
Ain't gimme time to put my bags down, she straight up clownin' (straight up clownin')
Before we end up fightin' lemme me leave
I'm exhausted, and this herree, I don't need (I don't need)
Now I'm wit the fellaz, ridin' and drinkin' (ridin' and drinkin')
She blowin' my two-way up, but I need some time for thinkin' (time for thinkin') yeah

Lemme give her some space, and the next day I might call (call)
What should I do, look, lemme ask ya'll
Should I stand tall, or let this relationship fall? (fall)
I never havin' my feelings crushed, but it happens sometimes
Either love it or give it up
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like "damn"

To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman
Good times let the bad times, and you ain't see it comin'
Tried the best to make her happy (happy), but it wasn't enough (it wasn't enough)
Cuz mama told me in relationships the road get rough (road get rough)
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weeping, stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route (route), yes
I thought I was a man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like "damn"
