There's a new world somewhere
They call the promised land,
And I'll be there someday
If you will hold my hand
I'll still need you there beside me
No matter what I do
For I know I'll never find another you
There is always someone
For each of us, they say
And you'll be my someone
Forever and a day
I could search the whole world over
Until my life is through
But I know I'll never find another you
It's a long, long journey
So stay by my side
When I walk through the storm
You'll be my guide
Be my guide
If they gave me a fortune
My pleasure would be small.
I could lose it all tomorrow
And never mind at all
But if I should lose your love, dear
I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you
But if I should lose your love, dear
I don't know what I'd do
For I know I'll never find another you
Another you
Another you
