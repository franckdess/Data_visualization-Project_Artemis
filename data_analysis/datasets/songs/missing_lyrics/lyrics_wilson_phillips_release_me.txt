I know that it's time for a change
Mmm but when that change comes
Will it still feel the same?

How many times have I tried
To turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground

Can you release me?
Can you release me?

Now that you're gone
I can't help myself from wondering
Ohh, if you'd have come down from your high
Would we've been all right?

Release me
Can you release me?

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
Release me, release me

I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing
Though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for

Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
Somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

Now tell me
What is this power you've got on me?
What is this power? Ohh

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

Release me, release me
Release me, will you release me?
Ahh, release me
Release me, will you release me?
