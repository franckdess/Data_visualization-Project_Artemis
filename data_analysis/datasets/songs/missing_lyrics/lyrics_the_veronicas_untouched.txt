I go, "Ooh-ooh", you go, "Ah, ah"
La-la-la-la, a-la-la-la
I can't lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
I wanna, wanna, wanna get, get, get what I want
Don't stop
Gimme, gimme, gimme what you got, got
'Cause I can't wait, wait, wait anymore, more, more, more
Don't even talk about the consequence
'Cause right now, you're the only thing that's making any sense to me
And I don't give a damn what they say, what they think, think
'Cause you're the only one who's on my mind
I'll never ever let you leave me
I'll try to stop time forever, never wanna hear you say goodbye (Goodbye)

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much
Somehow I can't forget you
Been going crazy from the moment I met you

(Untouched, un-)
And I need you so much

See you, breathe you, I want to be you
A-la-la-la, a-la-la-la
You can take, take, take, take, take time, time
To live, live the way you gotta, gotta live your life
Gimme, gimme, gimme all of you, you
Don't be scared
I'll see you through the loneliness of wanting more, more, more
Don't even think about what's right or wrong, or wrong or right
'Cause in the end, it's only you and me
And no one else is gonna be around
To answer all the questions left behind
And you and I are meant to be
So even if the world falls down today
You've still got me to hold you up, up
And I will never let you down (Down)

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much
Somehow, I can't forget you
Been going crazy from the moment I met you

(Untouched, un-, untouched
Untouched, un-, untouched
Untouched, un-)
A-la-la-la, a-la-la-la
(Untouched, un-)
A-la-la-la, a-la-la-la

I feel so untouched
And I want you so much
That I just can't resist you
It's not enough to say that I miss you
I feel so untouched right now
Need you so much
Somehow, I can't forget you
Been going crazy from the moment I met you

(Untouched, un-, untouched
Untouched, un-)
