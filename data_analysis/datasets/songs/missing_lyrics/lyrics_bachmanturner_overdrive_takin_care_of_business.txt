You get up every morning from alarm clock's warning
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime, work out
Whoo


If it were easy as fishing, you could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a secondhand guitar, chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
You tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

And we've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
We've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime
Funky


Whoo
All right, ow!
I love it!
Take good care of my business
When I'm away, every day
Whoo!

(Ha ha, whoo hoo, oh yeah)

You get up every morning from alarm clock's warning

And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed

And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime, take care

Takin' care of business, whoo!
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business, yo
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
Takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business, working overtime, whoo!

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business
We've been takin' care of business, whoo!
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
