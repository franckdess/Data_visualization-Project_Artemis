Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say good-bye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
(End of the road)
Still I can't let go
(The end of the road and I know I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road
(I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still I can't let go
(Oh my God, Oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
(Baby, I'm here for you, baby)
Just like you did baby but that's all right
(Baby, you tried)
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day, baby
(We should be happy together forever, you and I)
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby
â€™Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you? Just come back to me

(Lonely)
Yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(Lonely)
My heart hurts, baby
(Lonely)
Yes I feel pain too
Baby, please

This time instead just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me go

Although we've come to the end of the road
(We've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go
(I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural (No no), you belong to me, I belong to you
(No no no no no no)
(I don't know what I'm going to do)
Come to the end of the road
(I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still I can't let go
(Oh my God, Oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural (baby), you belong to me (baby), I belong to you
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
(We've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go
(I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural (No no), you belong to me (No no no no no no)
I belong to you
