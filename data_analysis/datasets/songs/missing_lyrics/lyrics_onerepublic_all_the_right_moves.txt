Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear
And the sounds you like
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces?
It can't be possible, that rain can fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over the world that's dead
They've got, they've got

Someone that'll look like you

Someone that could sound like you
