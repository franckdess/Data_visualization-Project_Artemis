What goes around comes back around 
Hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around
Hey, my baby
I say, what goes around comes back around
Hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around

There was a time
I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been outta my mind

So when I think of the time that I
Almost loved you
You showed your ass and I
I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
So baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
And I'm gon' always be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh, yeah
I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time
That I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And baby, yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Said, you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Hmm, and I'll never be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh baby, I bet
Sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one who's got away
Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God
I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
So through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
And I will always be the
(Best thing you never had)
(Best thing you never had)
Ooh best thing you never had

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
Oh, I will never be the
(Best thing you never had)
Oh, baby
I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around comes back around
What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
