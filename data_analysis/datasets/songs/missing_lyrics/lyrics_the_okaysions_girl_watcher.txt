I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by
My, my, my
I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now
Mmmm, mmm, mmm
I was just a boy
When I threw away my toys
I found a new pastime
To dwell on
Whenever I detect
Members of the other s**
I play the game I do so well, oh
I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by
My, my, my
I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now
Hello there, female
My, my, but you do look swell
Could you please walk
A little slower
I wonder if you know
That you're putting on a show
Could you please walk
A little closer
I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by
My, my, my
I'm a girl watcher
I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now
Mmm, mmm, mmm
