I was walking, down a one way street
Just a looking, for someone to meet
One woman, who was looking for a man
Now I'm hoping (hoping) that the feeling is right
And I'm wondering (wondering) if you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
Oh you're making me believe it too

Now the feeling, is beginning to grow
And the meaning, is something you only know
If you believe it, take my hand and I'll take your heart
Come on
Now I'm wondering (wondering) where does true love begin
I'm going under (under) so I'm letting you in
My woman (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

(Do you believe in love)
Do you believe in love
(Do you believe it's true)
You believe it's true
(Do you believe in love)
Oh you're making me believe it too

(I used to have you in a photograph)
I'm so glad it's changed
(But now I've got you and it's gonna last)
Do you believe in love

(Do you believe in love)
(Do you believe it's true)
I'm so glad! I'm so glad!
(Do you believe in love)
Oh you're making me believe it too, girl

(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Do you believe in love?
(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, wee ooh)
Do you believe it's true?
(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Do you believe in love?
(Wee ooh, ooh ooh, wee ooh)
I believe in love too
