I should have known better than to let you go alone
It's times like these I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again

I find I spend my time waiting on your call
How can I tell you babe? My back's against the wall
I need you by my side to tell me "It's alright"
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore

Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love, cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me

I can't stop the feeling I've been this way before
But with you I've found the key to open any door
I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms

Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love, cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me


Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?

Is this love?
Is this love?
