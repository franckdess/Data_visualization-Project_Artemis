Seventeen, a beauty queen
She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town
Her long blonde hair
Hangin' down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Fallin' down across her arms
Hidin' all the lady's charms
Lady Godiva
She found fame and made her name
A Hollywood director came
Into town
And said to her
"How'd you like to be a star?
You're a girl that could go far
Specially dressed the way you are"
She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake, a-hey-hey-hey
Lady Godiva
He directs certificate 'X'
And people now are cranin' their necks
To see her
'Cause she's a star
The one that everybody knows
Finished with the striptease shows
Now, she can't afford her clothes
Her long blonde hair
Lyin' on the barber's floor
Doesn't need it long anymore
Lady Godiva
