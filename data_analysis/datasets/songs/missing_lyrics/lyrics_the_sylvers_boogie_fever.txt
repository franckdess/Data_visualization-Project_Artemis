Boogie fever
Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around
I took my baby to the drive-in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie
Digging funky sound
She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around
I took my baby to the pizza parlor
To get a bite to eat
I put some money in the jukebox for her
You know, she ate her pizza
Dancing to the beat
She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
She's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around
All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump
Yes, we did, yes, we did
Yes, we did, yeah
She kept it going strong
Doing the bump, bump, bump
Doing the bump, bump, bump
I called the doctor on the telephone
Doctor, doctor
Said doctor, doctor, please
I, I, I
I got this feeling rocking and a'reeling
Tell me, what can it be
Is it some new disease?
They call it boogie fever
You've got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around
Fever, fever, fever
All night long
We did the bump, bump, bump
Yes, we did
Yes, we did, yes we did
We kept it going strong
Doing the bump, bump, bump
Everybody's got the boogie fever
Boogie down, now get on down
Now get on down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around
And around, and around
I got the boogie fever
And I said you got the boogie fever
I said she's got the boogie fever
Everybody's got the boogie fever
Boogie fever
Boogie down
Just get on down
Just get on down
Boogie fever
