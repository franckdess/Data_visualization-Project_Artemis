I thumbed my way
From LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights
Ain't where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain
I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams
I'm coming home
But tears filled my eyes
When I found out she was gone

Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
I've got to find her
Can you make these big wheels burn?


I can't blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes
