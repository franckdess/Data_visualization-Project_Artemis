{In some versions of the lyrics}
Move over dad cause I'm a double dipple
Upside down on the big dip dipper
I've got a ticket come ride with me
Let me go down on the merry-go-round
All is fair 'n' a big fairground
Let's go slow, let's go fast
Like a licorice twist gonna whip your ass
Roller coaster say what I will be there for you I will be your man
