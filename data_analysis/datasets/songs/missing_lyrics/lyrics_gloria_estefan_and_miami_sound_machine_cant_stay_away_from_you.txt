"Time flies when you're having fun"
I heard somebody say
But if all I've been is fun
Then baby let me go
Don't wanna be in your way
And I don't wanna be your second choice
Don't wanna be just your friend
You keep telling me that you're not in love
You wanna throw it all away
But I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control
Your love is slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you
Hold on to every bit of hope
That's all I ever do
Hoping you might change your mind
And call me up to say
How much you need me too
And though you're leaving me no other choice
Than to turn and walk away
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there
You can count on me to stay
'Cause I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control
Your love slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you
