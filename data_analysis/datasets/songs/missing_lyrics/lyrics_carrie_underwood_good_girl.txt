Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
So good for him
Better back away, honey, you don’t know where he’s been

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes and go, go, go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he’s low
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, he’s no good, girl
Why can’t you see?
He’ll take your heart and break it
Listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He’s no good, he’s no good
Won’t you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find

He’s no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
