Fo' real and that's no question
No frontin' and no guessin'

Caramel Complexion
Body-Body-Body-Body like heaven

Uh-huh, come on
You can say I'm plain Jane but it's not the same
I ain't into big names but I like nice things
I watch boxin' matches and the football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress but I love to sing
I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home and curl up next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm havin' sex with ya

Anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it
(No frontin' and no guessin')
5' 5" with brown eyes
(Caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise
(Body like heaven)
'Cause anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it
(No frontin' and no guessin')
5' 5" with brown eyes
(Caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise
(Body like heaven)

Baby, look me in the eyes and tell me yeah
I'm the kind of girl you like, I'm feelin' you
'Cause sweetie you're my kind of guy, that's what it is
Think about it you just might wanna run with this
All night long and if you want me, we can keep this going
But let me tell you I'm the type that's strong
And I don't trust a lot of men, I'm independent
I ain't like some other women

Anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it
(No frontin' and no guessin')
5' 5" with brown eyes
(Caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise

Ven aqui, Ven aqui Mama
Baby girl don't you know you're a star
We could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5' brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized

I keep 'em mesmerized, listen to me closely
E-V-E is how a thorough bred supposed to be
Hate the thirsty type, can't even get close to me
That's why I got my own stack, Daddy, how it's supposed to be
I ain't about the game, playin' and gift chasin'
All in frontin' Daddy please, we both big facin'
All the things I want, I got, forget me not
Just from my stance, why you starin' at me? Got you hot
Not too many bitches like her, one of a kind
I mean even the bitches like her, she just a dime
Not impressed by your Cris' poppin' 'cause if you would
I might end, of the night we gone be lip locking
But only if I choose to, I don't fall in love easily
Give you the blues Boo, I have you sittin'
'Round misty-eyed Caramel, get 'em all the time
Hot shit from City High
