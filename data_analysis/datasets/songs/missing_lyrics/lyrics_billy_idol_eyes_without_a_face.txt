I'm all out of hope
One more bad dream
Could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release

(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face

I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face

When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Oh, the gigolo pool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down, oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you and you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realise

(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face
Such a human waste
You're eyes without a face

And now it's getting worse
