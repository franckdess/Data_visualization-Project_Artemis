Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it’s all mine, oh, oh-oh
Do what you want, but you’re never gonna break me
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, oh-oh

Take me away (Take me away)
A secret place (A secret place)
A sweet escape (A sweet escape)
Take me away (Take me away)
Take me away (Take me away)
To better days (To better days)
Take me away (Take me away)
A hiding place (A hiding place)

I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it’s all mine, oh, oh-oh
(Got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine, got a love, and I know that it's all mine)
Do what you want, but you’re never gonna break me, oh
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, oh-oh
(Never gonna shake me, never gonna shake me)
I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it’s all mine, oh, oh-oh
(I know, I know that it's all mine)
Wish that you could, but you ain’t gonna own me
Do anything you can to control me, oh, oh no
(You can't control me, you can't control me)

Take me away (Take me away)
A secret place (A secret place)
A sweet escape (A sweet escape)
Take me away (Take me away)
Take me away (Take me away)
To better days (To better days)
Take me away (Take me away)
A hiding place (A hiding place)

There’s a place that I go, that nobody knows
Where the rivers flow, and I call it home
And there’s no more lies, in the darkness, there’s light
And nobody cries, there’s only butterflies

Take me away (Take me away)
A secret place (A secret place)
A sweet escape (A sweet escape)
Take me away (Take me away)
Take me away (Take me away)
To better days (To better days)
Take me away (Take me away)
A hiding place (A hiding place)
Take me away (Take me away)
A secret place (A secret place)
A sweet escape (A sweet escape)
Take me away (Take me away)
Take me away (Take me away)
To better days (To better days)
Take me away (Take me away)
A hiding place (A hiding place)

Take me away (I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine)
A secret place (I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh)
To better days (To better days)
Take me away (Take me away)
Take me away (I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine)
(I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh)
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (Take me away)
A hiding place (A hiding place)

Oh yeah, oh
Mhm

The sun is on my side and takes me for a ride
I smile up to the sky, I know I'll be alright
