Girl, well it's been one of those days again
And it seems like the harder I try
Over and over, I'm right back where I began
But you understand
Oh girl, when nothing else in this world goes right
Oh I just want to run to you
You pull me through
Oh baby, who wouldn't want to have you in their life?

Tell me, what kind of man would I be
Living a life without any meaning?
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever was gone with one touch of your hand
Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see, oh baby
Once that I found you there was no letting go
