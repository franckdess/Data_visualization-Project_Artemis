Bad boy, bad boy

Boys will be boys
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Always get so restless)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(If you're feeling breathless)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad, bad, bad, bad, boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would

The way you hold me tight
You get me so excited
You do me oh so right
My heart goes beat beat
Beat beat, beat beat

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad, bad, bad, bad, boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would

Boys will be boys

Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(If you're feeling breathless)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy

And when he drives me home
I feel safe at night
You call me on the phone
It goes ring, ring, ring
Ring-a-ring, ring

Boys will be boys
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Always get so restless)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(If you're feeling breathless)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Always get so restless)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(Nothing but trouble)
Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
(If you're feeling breathless)
Bad boy, bad boy
