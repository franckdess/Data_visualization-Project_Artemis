When life is too much, roll with it, baby
Don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
Hard times knocking on your door
I'll tell them you ain't there no more
Get on through it, roll with it, baby

Luck'll come and then slip away
You've gotta move, bring it back to stay

You just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
You and me, roll with it, baby
Hang on and just roll with it, baby, hey

The way that you love is good as money
I swear by stars above, sweet as honey
People think you're down and out
You show them what it's all about
You can make it, roll with it, baby

When this world turns its back on you
Hang in and do that sweet thing you do

You just roll with it, baby, yeah
You just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
You and me, just roll with it, baby
Roll with it, baby, yeah
You just roll with it, baby
You and me, just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby

Hey, now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby
You'll hear the music play, you'll dance, baby
You'll leave bad times way behind
Nothing but good times on your mind
You can do it, roll with it, baby

Then you'll see life will be so nice
It's just a step up to paradise

You just roll with it, baby, yeah
You just roll with it, baby
You and me, just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby
Hey, come on
Roll with me, baby
Hey now, baby
Roll, roll, roll with me baby, roll
Hey, c'mon and roll
Come roll with me, baby
Come and roll
Hang on and just roll, hey and roll
