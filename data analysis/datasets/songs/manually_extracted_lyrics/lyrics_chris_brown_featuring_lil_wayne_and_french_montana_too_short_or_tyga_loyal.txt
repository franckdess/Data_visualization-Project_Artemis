Young Mula, baby!
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine 'bout half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes (CB fuck with me!)
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley, I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trapped
She wanna fuck all the rappers
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it (right away)
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
A nigga fell in love
Turn into a woosy
24-7 he was eating that pussy
But these hoes ain't faithful
A nigga like me will have your bitch on tape though
I been knowing not to trust these hoes
I get bread, get head, and fuck these hoes
In that order
Don't switch it around
Relationships change, it's so different now
No high-school sweetheart
These bitches pimpin'
All these opinions
Women on women
Lickin' them titties
Sex in the City
Hella "Instagram likes" but you ain't pretty, bitch!
Come on, come on, girl why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You don' spent bread on her
And it's all for nothing
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
When I rich nigga want you (Want you babe)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (Oh)
Oh these hoes ain't loyal
Whoa these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Yeah, let me see
Yeah, let me see
Let me see
Oh these hoes ain't loyal
