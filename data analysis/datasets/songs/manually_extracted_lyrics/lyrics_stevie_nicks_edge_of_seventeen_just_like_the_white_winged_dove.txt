Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Who who who
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him all alone
On the edge of seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song 
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
I went today maybe I will go again
Tomorrow
And the music there it was hauntingly
Familiar
And I see you doing 
What I try to do for me
With the words from a poet
And the voice from a choir
And a melody nothing else mattered
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
The clouds never expect it
When it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea 
Does not change
And so with the slow graceful flow
Of age
I went forth with an age old
Desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Well then suddenly 
There was no one left standing
In the hall yeah yeah
In a flood of tears 
That no one really ever heard fall at all
Oh I went searchin' for an answer,
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing
Come away come away
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you
At nightfall
Sometime to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you
My love
I'm a few years older than you
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
