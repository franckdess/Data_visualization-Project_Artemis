Straight from da bay, posted in tha 'A'
'Bout to hit tha club; we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' some rusty, dyin'-off Patron
VIP status, strapped wit' my chrome
Look around tha club, what do I see?
Everybody rockin' from side to side to tha beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to tha groove
All by they self; that's tha new move
Nigga, where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up tha game; I'm seein' how it's done
I ask shawty what they call it
She said tha Pool Palace
Straight from Bank head
I said you good at it
Do what cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playas and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, tha more it's lookin' smooth
It's nothin' to a boss
I can do tha shit too
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo' self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo' self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Chillin' in tha bip, yeah, we get crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up tha kush, put it in tha air
I'm throwin' up tha E's to let em' know we in here
Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out tha ol' school 'cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah, I'm from tha 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my glock, bitch!
Reppin' my block, bitch, straight from tha deck
When you snap ya fingers, shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on tha best; we don't fuck wit' dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah, I'm back to tha track, back to tha snap
One, two step, then you gotta lean back
Dis is how we do it in tha 'A town'
(And if you ain't know) this how it goes down
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo' self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo' self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay! Hey! Hey!
