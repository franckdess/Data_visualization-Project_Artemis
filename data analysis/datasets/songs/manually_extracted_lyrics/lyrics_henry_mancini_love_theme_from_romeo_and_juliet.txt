What is a youth
Impetuous fire
What is a maid
Ice and desire
The world wags on
A rose will bloom
It then will fade
So does the youth
So does the fairest maid
Comes a time when one sweet smile
Hasn't seasoned for awhile
Then loves in loves with me
Some they only think to marry
Other will tease and terry
Mine is the very best perry
Cupid he rules us all
Caper the caper sing me the song
Death will come soon to hush us along
Sweeter than honey, bitter than gull
Love is the past time that will never pull
Sweeter than honey, bitter than gull
Cupid he rules us all
A rose will bloom, it then will fade
So does the youth, so does the fairest maid
