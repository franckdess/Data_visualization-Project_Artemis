Lovin' you is easy cause you're beautiful
Makin' love with you is all I wanna do
Lovin' you is more than just a dream come true
And everything that I do is out of lovin' you

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Do do do do do, ooh

No one else can make me feel
The colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in springtime
Cause lovin' you has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life is filled with lovin' you
Lovin' you I see your soul come shinin' through
And every time that we, ooh, I'm more in love with you

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Do do do do do, ooh

No one else can make me feel
The colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in springtime
Cause lovin' you is easy cause you're beautiful
And every day of my life is filled with lovin' you
Lovin' you I see your soul come shinin' through
And every time that we, ooh, I'm more in love with you

La la la la la, la la la la la
