You and i got something
But it's all and then it's nothing to me, yeah
And i got my defenses
When it comes through your intentions for me, yeah
And we wake up in the breakdown
With the things we never thought we could be, yeah

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you darling
I thought i lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And i want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And i wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

I am no solution
To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah
And i was not the answer
So forget you ever thought it was me, yeah

I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you darling
I thought i lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

And i want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And i wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

And i don't need the fallout
Of all the past that's in between us
And i'm not holding on
And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here

And i want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And i wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

And i want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
And i can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah
