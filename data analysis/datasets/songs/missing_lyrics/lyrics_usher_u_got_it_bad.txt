Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ouh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad


You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...
