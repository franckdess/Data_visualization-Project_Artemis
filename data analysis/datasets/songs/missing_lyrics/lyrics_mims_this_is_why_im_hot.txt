This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply:

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme whachu got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say "Yeah, I paid a guap"
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em "All aboard"
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply "Nobody got to die"
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
