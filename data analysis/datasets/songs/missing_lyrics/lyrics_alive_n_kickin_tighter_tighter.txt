You know I got to show you
Nobody else before you
Ever gave me such
A beautiful feeling
Oh, woman, you
Touched a-my soul now
Honey, don't you let go now
Hold on, baby
Just a little bit tighter
Hold on
Just a little bit tighter now, baby
I love you so much and
I can't let go, no no no
Hold on, a just a little bit
Tighter now, baby
Love is so surprising
Opened up my eyes and
You reached out and
Took my hand
Baby, you touched a-my soul now
Woman, don't let go now
Hold on, baby
Just a little bit tighter
Hold on
Just a little bit tighter now, baby
I love you so much and
I can't let go, no no no
Hold on, a just a little bit
Tighter now, baby
Oh, woman, you
Touched a-my soul now
Honey, don't you let go now
Hold on, baby
Just a little bit tighter
