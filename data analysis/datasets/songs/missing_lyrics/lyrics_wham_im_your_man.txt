Call me good
Call me bad
Call me anything you want to, baby
But I know that you’re sad
And I know I’ll make you happy
With the one thing that you never had

Baby, I’m your man
Don’t you know that?

So good, you’re divine
Wanna take you, wanna make you
But they tell me it’s a crime!
Everybody knows where the good people go
But where we’re going baby
Ain’t no such word as no!

Baby, I’m your man
Don’t you know who I am?
Baby, I’m your man

When you can have mine?

Baby, your friends do not need to know!
I’ve got a real nice place to go
