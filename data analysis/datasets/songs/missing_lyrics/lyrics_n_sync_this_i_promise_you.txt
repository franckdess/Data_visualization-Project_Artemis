Oh, oooh, oooh

When the visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength
I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing there all along

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Til' the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart (give you my heart)
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow
Forever has now begun

Just close your eyes (close your eyes)
Each loving day (each loving day)
I know this feeling won't go away (no)
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you..
This I promise you..

Over and over I fall
(Over and over I fall)
When I hear you call
Without you in my life, baby
I just wouldn't be living at all

And I will take you in my arms
(I will take you in my arms)
And hold you right where you belong
(Right where you belong)
Til' the day my life is through
This I promise you, baby
Just close your eyes
Each loving day (each loving day)
I know this feeling won't go away (no)
Every word I say is true
This I promise you

Every word I say is true
This I promise you
Ooh, I promise you
