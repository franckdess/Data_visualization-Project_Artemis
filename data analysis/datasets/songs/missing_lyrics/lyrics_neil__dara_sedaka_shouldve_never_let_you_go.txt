When you walk into a room
Your beauty steals my breath away
When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say
Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should have never let you go
(should have never let her go)
Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share
But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear
I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so
Why did I have to write this song
I should have never let you go
Why in all the wide, wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear
I'll never understand
I'll never understand
Why I even give a damn
When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground
I've built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down
You're the kind I can't forget
Let the tears begin to flow
I have only one regret
I should have never let you.....go
Should have never let you go
Should have never let you go
Should have never let you go
Should have never let you go
