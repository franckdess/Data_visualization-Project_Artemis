The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said "Hello" and I said "Hi"
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby, you were more than just a face

And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you

Oh, yeah
Yeah, y-y-y-yeah
The very next time she'll be my friend
If I say that I could be your one and only
(Promise, promise, promise)
Promise that you'll never leave me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need
Oh, baby
I just wanna be the one to serve you
Sometimes, I feel as if I don't deserve you
I cherish every moment that we share

And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you

My friend
The very next time she will be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
(I need someone who'll be my friend)
My friend
The very next time she will be my friend
(To be with me through thick and thin)
My friend
The very next time she will be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
(Please share my love with me, my friend)
My friend
The very next time she will be my friend
(I need someone like you)

And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
