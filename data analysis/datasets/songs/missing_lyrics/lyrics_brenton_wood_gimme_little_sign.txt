If you do want me, gimme little sugar
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling blue and I want you
There's just one thing that you should do
Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show that you're mine girl
Oh yeah
Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show that you're mine girl
All right
If you do want me, gimme little sweet talk
If you don't want me, don't lead me on girl
But if you need me, show me that you love me
And when I'm feeling down, wearing a frown
You be there when I look around
{Bridge}
Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my baby
To show that you're mine girl
Oh yeah
Just gimme some kind of sign girl
Oh my darling
To show that you're mine girl
Oh yeah
Sign, Oooh Ooh...
