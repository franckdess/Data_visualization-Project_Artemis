When I get home, babe
Gonna light your fire
All day I've been thinkin' about you, babe
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I wanna taste your lips
I wanna be your fantasy, yeah
Don't know what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me
Every time I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin' in my arms
And you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
I love you
I need you, yeah
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Stay with me, lay with me, holding me, loving me, baby
Here with me, near with me, feeling you close to me, baby
So show me, show me everything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you
I need you, yeah
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
