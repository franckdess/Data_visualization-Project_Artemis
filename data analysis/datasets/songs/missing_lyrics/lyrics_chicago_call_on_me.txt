The feeling was clear
Clear as a blue sky on a Sunday day
Everything was you
Because no one made me feel
The way I felt with you
Call on me because

I love you
You know I do
You love me too

Then came a change
When I said I would soon be leaving you
Nothing else to do
Please remember I never lose the thought of you
Call on me because


You've got to find
Someone else to somehow take my place
Share his life with you
But if you need a friend
You can always count on me
Count on me because


You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
