I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

I'm feeling sexy
I wanna hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe has just taken over me
Start feeling so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feeling so crazy, babe

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy
Tonight, I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor
I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me

Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe has just taken over me
Start feeling so crazy, babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feeling so crazy, babe

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)
I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)
I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)
I love to love you, baby (I love to love you, baby)

Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
