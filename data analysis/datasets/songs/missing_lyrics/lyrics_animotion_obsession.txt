You are an obsession (You are an obsession)
I cannot (I cannot sleep) sleep
I am a possession (I am your possession)
Unopened at your feet
There's no balance (There is no balance)
No equality (No equality)
Be still (Be still)
I will not (I will not) accept defeat (accept defeat)
I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly
I will collect you and capture you
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be

I feed you I drink you
My day and my night
I need you I need you
By sun or candlelight
You protest; you want to leave
Stay, oh, (there's no alternative) there's no alternative
Your face appears again
I see the beauty there
But I see danger
Stranger beware
Of circumstance in your naked dreams
Your affection is not what it seems
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?

You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me?
My fantasy (My fantasy) has turned to madness (has turned to madness)
And all my goodness (and all my goodness) has turned to badness (has turned to badness)

My life is trembling; I have no control
I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
