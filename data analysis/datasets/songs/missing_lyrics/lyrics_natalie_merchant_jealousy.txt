Oooh, jealousy

Is she fine
So well bred
The perfect girl
A social deb
Is she the sort
You've always thought
Could make you
What you're not?

Oooh, jealousy

Is she bright so well read are there novels by her bed
Is she the sort
You've always said
Could satisfy
Your head?

Oooh, jealousy

Does she talk
The way i do
Is her voice reminding you
Of the promises
The little white lies too
Sometimes, tell me
While she's touching you
Just by mistake
Accidentally do you say my name?
