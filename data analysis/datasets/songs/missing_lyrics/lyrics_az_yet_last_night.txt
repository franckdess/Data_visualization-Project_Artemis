Last night, you were so into it
You told me secrets that, you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine, as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and, so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight, in your soul
You felt incredible, I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Sunlight, red red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so, I'm so in love

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night (Last night)
I was inside of you (Inside of you)
Last night (Last night)
While making love to you (While making love to you)
I saw the sun (The sun), the moon (The moon), the mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
