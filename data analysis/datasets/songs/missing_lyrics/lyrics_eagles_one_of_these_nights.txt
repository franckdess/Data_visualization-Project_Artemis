One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one
Oh, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight

Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you baby one of these nights
One of these nights
Hoo, hoo hoo
Hoo, hoo hoo
One of these nights
I, I can feel it
I can feel it
One of these nights
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you now
One of these nights
Baby, so don't, don't
I'm all alone
One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you
Coming right behind you
One of these nights
Hoo, hoo hoohoohoo
One of these nights
All I wanna say, ahhh
One of these nights
