You lie in gentle
Sleep beside me
I hear your warm
And rhythmic breathing
I take your hand
And hold it tightly
(Listen) can you not hear
Our young hearts beating
I kiss the sleep
From your eyes
Your smile is sweeter
Than the morning
And a-here it comes
Can't you feel it baby
Can't you feel it
Here it comes
Feel it, feel it
Fire, fire
Something's burning
Something's burning
Something's burning
And I think it's love
And now the sun
Is burning brightly
We lie in love
So close together
I get the feeling
Deep inside me
My love for you
Will burn forever
I cup my hands
To touch your face
And once again
I feel your fire
And a-here it comes
Can't you feel it, baby
Can't you feel it
Here it comes again
Feel it, feel it
Fire, fire
Something's burning
Something's burning
Something's burning
And I think it's love
And I think it's love
And I think it's love
And I think it's love
Can't you feel the fire
Keeps burnin'
Can't you feel the fire
Keeps burnin'
Can't you feel the fire
Keeps burnin'
And I think it's love
And I think it's love
Can't you feel the fire
Keeps burnin'
Can't you feel the fire
Keeps burnin'
Can't you feel the fire
Keeps burnin'
And I think it's love
And I think it's love
