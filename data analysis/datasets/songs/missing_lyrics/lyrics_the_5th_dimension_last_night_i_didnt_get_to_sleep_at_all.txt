Last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no
I lay awake and watched until the morning light
Washed away the darkness of the lonely night (Lonely night)
Oh, and last night, I got to thinking maybe I, I, I
Should call you up and just forget my foolish pride
I heard your number ringing, I went cold inside
And last night, I didn't get to sleep at all
I know it's not my fault, I did my best
God knows this heart of mine could use a rest
But more and more I find the dreams I left behind
Are somehow too real to replace (Replace)
Oh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no
The sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time
I couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind
And last night, I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep
No, I didn't get to sleep at all
But more and more I find the dreams I left behind
Are somehow too real to replace (Replace)
Oh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no
The sleeping pill I took was just a waste of time
I couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind
And last night, I didn't get to sleep, didn't get to sleep
No, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no, no
(No, no, no) No, no, no
Oh, last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, no, no
Last night, I didn't get to sleep at all, oh, oh
Last night
