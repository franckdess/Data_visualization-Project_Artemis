Am I giving enough
Is it all it should be
When the water gets rough
Will you still swim with me?
So afraid to come close
I know that it may be too soon
It may be too much
For you to consume

And I want to know if I can live inside your world
And I want to know if I can give it to you girl

You know that I want to say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I'd love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on
You know that I want to say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I'd love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on

I give you all that you need
There's no better place you could be
And I know that in time
You will believe me
So please hold out your hand
And let's exchange these golden bands
Cause I want you in my life
I want you to be my wife

And I want to know if I can live inside your world
And I want to know if I can give it to you girl

You know that I want to say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I'd love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on
You know that I want to say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I'd love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on

My girl, is so special
I want to give it all to you
Loving you on and on
My girl, is so special
I want to give it all to you
Loving you on and on

You know that I want to say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I'd love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on
You know that I want to say it
You know that I need to say it
You know that I'd love to say it
My love just goes on and on and on
