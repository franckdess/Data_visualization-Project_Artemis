Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
{Instrumental Bridge}

Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling...
