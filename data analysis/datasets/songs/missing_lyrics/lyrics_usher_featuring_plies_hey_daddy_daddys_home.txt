I just wanna get your attention
I really wanna be all up in your head (turn the lights on)
'Cause what I got, you going to get some
But girl, that's only if you ain't scared

And I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
(Hey, south side)

I ain't gotta do a lot of flexing
Shorty, you already know what it is, yeah
And girl, tonight we gonna do a lot of sexing, yeah
Can't nobody do your body like this

Oh, I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
Said I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

Oh, Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
(Let him know what you like)
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
(Let him know what you like)
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy

Knock knock, guess what? The goon's home
Gone three days, bought a quarter mil home
Miss me to death, guess what she wrote
I miss you too, put that on your ringtone
Told her when I get back, she can have the Range Rov'
But I'ma take it back, if she ride lame, hoe
Isn't that the house you wanted? I'll buy you two of those
A hundred thou, baby? That's just two shows
Have you ever made love with your neck froze
With all VVS diamonds in your ear lobes?
Stay out the Maybach, baby, 'cause it ain't yours
I would've bought you one, but you wanted the Benzo
Take your shoes off and I'll rub your fat toes
Let me pour Kool-Aid on you, real slow
And I'll kiss it all off before it hits the floor
Daddy's home, you know how that goes

Is you say, "Daddy's home, oh, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
Your daddy's home, it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
Now, baby, you ain't got to give my loving away
"Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
(Daddy's home, so it's time to play)
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy

Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back while you work that chair
Do your damn thing, let the neighbors hear
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'ma fall back and let you work that chair
Do your damn thing, all I want to hear
