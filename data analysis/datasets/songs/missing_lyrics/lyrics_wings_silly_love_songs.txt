You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me, and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me (I love you)
Now can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me (I love you)
Now can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know, 'cause here I go again
I love you, I love you
Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you) How can I tell you about my loved one? (I love you)
I love you
I love you
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say, can't you see?)
I love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say, can't you see?)
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?)
(How can I tell you about my loved one?)
I love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me
Say, can't you see?)
I love you
(I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?)
{How can I tell you about my loved one?}
I love you
(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me
Say, can't you see?)
{How can I tell you about my loved one?}
I love you
(I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me
Say, can't you see?)
{How can I tell you about my loved one?}
I love you
(Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me
Say, can't you see?)
{How can I tell you about my loved one?}

You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh, no
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
