She was black as the night;
Louie was whiter than white
Danger, danger when you taste brown sugar
Louie fell in love overnight
Nothing bad, it was good
Louie had the best girl he could
When he took her home
To meet his mama and papa;
Louie knew just where he stood
Louie Louie Louie louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry
There he stood in the night
Knowing what's wrong from what's right
He took her home to meet his mama and papa
Man, they had a terrible fight
Louie nearly caused a scene
Wishin' it was a dream
Ain't no diff'rence if you're black or white
Brothers, you know what I mean, come on
Louie Louie Louie
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry
{Instrumental}
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie Louie Lou I
Louie Louie Louie Louie, Louie Louie you're gonna cry
