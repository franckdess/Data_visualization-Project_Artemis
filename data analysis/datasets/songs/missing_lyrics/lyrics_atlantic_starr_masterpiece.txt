A simple touch of your hand
And everything is right
The gentle way you look at me
When we kiss goodnight
You've given me the freedom
No other love has known
And now I thank you, girl
Thank you, girl
The countless ways
You've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away
A picture perfect painting
That's what our love is
And, yes I need you so
And now I know

I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art
It's true
And I treasure you, my love
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art
It's true
And I treasure you

Sometimes I wonder
What I'd be
Had I not found you
A least and lonely soul
This world could show
Me nothing new
But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be
And now I see
The gentle walks together
Through time
We'll never part
This fairy tale
We shared is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise
I can make
Heaven is ours to take


When I'm lost and insecure
You build me up
And make me sure
That everything will be all right
My love

This fairy tale we're sharing
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end
Please, never let it end
Let's keep it together
Making love
We can do it if we try

Girl
I treasure you, baby
