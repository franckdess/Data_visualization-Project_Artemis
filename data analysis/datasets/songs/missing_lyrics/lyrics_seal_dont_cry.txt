Don't be so hard on yourself
Those tears are for someone else
I hear your voice on the phone
I hear you feel so alone
My baby
Oh, my baby
Please, my baby
My baby

When we were young
And truth was paramount
We were older then
And we lived our life without any doubt
Those memories
They seem so long ago
What's become of them?
When you feel like me, I want you to know

Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

Today I dreamed
Of friends I had before
And I wonder why
The ones who care don't call anymore
My feelings hurt
But you know I overcome the pain
And I'm stronger now
There can't be a fire unless there's a flame

Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

Limousines and sycophants
Don't leave me now, cause I'm afraid
What you've done to me
Is now the wolf in my bed
In my head
In my head
In my head

The challenges, we took were hard enough
They get harder now
Even when we think that we've had enough
Don't feel alone
Cause it's I you understand
I'm your sedative
Take a piece of me whenever you can

Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby
(I hear your voice on the phone)
(Tonight sweet baby)
(I hear you feel, so alone)

My baby
Don't cry tonight
You'll still be loved
