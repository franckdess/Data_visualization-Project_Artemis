You ain't crazy
I ain't gonna lie anymore
What you're feelin'
There's a reason for
I wanna do right
Oh, gotta do right
Do I love you, oh
You know I've tried
But what you're after
You can't find in my eyes
I'm gonna do right

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
This is our last chance
To touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

One by one
We're collecting lies
When you can't give love
You give alibis
Now, I'm gonna do right
This time I got to do right
I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna say goodbye
Sooner or later, honey
There comes a time
Mama, when you gotta do right
Come on, come on

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
From this one last chance to
Touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

Why are you so torn apart
I need a little more
Loving in my heart
People say that love will grow
So how was I to know
Love that's come
Through years and years
Can't find a way
Back home anymore

Darlin'
Tell me the truth
Don't turn away
This is our final chance to
Touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
(So darlin' tell me)
Maybe we're near the end
So, darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart
Does anything last forever
I don't know but
But maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So, darling, oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart
