I really don't feel like talking on the phone
And I really don't feel like company at home
Lately
I don't want to do the things I used to do
Baby, since I lost you

And I don't want to sing another love song, babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you, baby
Yeah
It's driving me crazy
(Crazy)

I really don't feel like smiling anymore
And I haven't had the peace to sleep at all
Ever since you went away, baby
My whole life has changed
I don't want to love
And I don't want to live

And I don't want to sing another love song, babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you, baby
Yeah
It's driving me crazy
(Crazy)

I don't wanna laugh
I don't wanna play
I don't wanna talk
I have nothing to say
I don't want to tour
Forget the show
How can I go on
Now that you are gone?

And I don't want to sing another love song, babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you, baby
Yeah
It's driving me crazy
(Crazy)
