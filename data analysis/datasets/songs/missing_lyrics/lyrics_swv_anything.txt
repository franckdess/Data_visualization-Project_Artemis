Anticipation of what's to come
I'm so happy that I'm the lucky one
So long I've waited but it's never too late for love
It feels so right, baby that it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because

Anything you wanna do
I am gonna try to
Boy, my body's just for you
Pleasure is the destination
You can drive us if you choose to
All my love for you

Whatever method used is alright with me
As long as you get to where you need to be
This is the vision made for both of our eyes to see
It feels so right, it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because

Anything you wanna do
I am gonna try to
Boy, my body's just for you
Pleasure is the destination
You can drive us if you choose to
All my love for you

Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Taj, another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit

Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Me me going downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen I ain't sweating no competition
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing

Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot

I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V

Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to do I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
It's all up to you
Anything
That you want me to do
You can have it
Ooohh
Anything you want to do right now
Anything that you want to do
Boy I'm gonna try to
My body's just for you
My love's just for you
The destination
You can drive
You can drive us there
If you choose to, this love is for you
Anything that you want to do
Boy I'm gonna try to
My body's just for you
My love's just for you
The destination
You can drive
You can drive us there
If you choose to, this love is for you
