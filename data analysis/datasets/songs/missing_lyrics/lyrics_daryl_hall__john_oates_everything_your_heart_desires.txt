You say you can't stand to be tied so close to a lover
Ooh, you feel like a prisoner
And you wanna find someone who will let you out
Can't you see the heartbeat that you know so well
Is better than some strange one you're looking for
Say, you never know that strange one
Just might be me, yeah
Can't you see you have everything your heart desires
So why you want more?
If you have (if you have), everything your heart desired
Would you still want more?
You have everything your heart desires
Why do you want more?
(If you have)
Everything your heart desires
Would you still want more?
You tell me your best friend's world seem beautiful
But don't be fooled
It's nice work if you can get it
Yeah, what goes on behind closed doors you don't know
Maybe she cries herself to sleep every night
Sorry that the heartbeat that she knows so well
Ain't what she's looking for
You never know that strange heart
Just might be me
Baby, you have everything your heart desires
So why you want more?
If you have (if you have), everything your heart desired
Would you still want more?
You have, oh, everything your heart desires
Why do you want more?
(If you have)
Everything your heart desires
Would you still want more?
Maybe you'll confess; girl, you'll see
If you want the world, if you want the world, think of me
No words can help, so don't be sad, oh no
'Cause baby, what you want is what you have
Yeah, hey...
Do you still want me?
(You have everything your heart desires)
Everything your heart desires
So why you want more?
(If you have everything your heart desires)
I can give you anything you want
(You have everything your heart desires)
As long as you know, I got what you need
You got the key, ooh baby
(If you have everything your heart desired)
I ain't gonna let you go
No no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no...
(You had everything your heart desired...)
