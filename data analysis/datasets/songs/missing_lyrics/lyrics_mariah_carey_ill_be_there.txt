This next song is made popular
By incredible Jackson 5
And it's always been one of my favorite songs
And I hope it's yours
It's called, "I'll be there"
Ooh, ooh

You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there (I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name
And I'll be there

I'll be there to comfort you
I'll build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you, yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well, it's all I'm after
Just call my name
And I'll be there (I'll be there)
Yeah, yeah
I'll be there to protect you (Yeah, baby)
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name
And I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
You know I'm so glad I found you, babe (So glad, baby)
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength (Be your strength)
You know I'll keep holding on (Holding on)

If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
Because if she doesn't
Then I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know, baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah-yeah, yeah
Just call my name (I'll be there)
And I'll be there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ah
I'll be there, baby (I'll be there)
You know I'll be there, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-ah
Just call my name (I'll be there)
And I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name (Yeah)
And I'll be there
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)

Thank you
