Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Whoa, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Whoa, you're a loaded gun
Whoa, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love a...


Oh, shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)

You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
