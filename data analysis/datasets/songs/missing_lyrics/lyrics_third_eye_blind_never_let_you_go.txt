There's every good reason
For letting you go
She's sneaky and smoked out
And it's starting to show

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you turn around, your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around, your back on each other

You say that I changed
Well maybe I did
But even if I changed
What's wrong with it?

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you turn around, your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around, your back on each other

And now our friends are gone, are gone
And all the time moves on and on
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong
And all I know is it's wrong, it's wrong
(It's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong)
If there's a reason, it's lost on me
Maybe we'll be friends, I guess we'll see

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you turn around, your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around, let's turn on each other
Good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around, your back on each other
That's a good idea, break a promise to your mother
Turn around, your back on each other
What a good idea

I remember the stupid things
The mood rings, the bracelets and the beads
Nickels and dimes, yours and mine
Did you cash in all your dreams?
You don't dream for me no, you don't dream for me no
But I still feel you pulsing like sonar from the days in the waves
That girl is like a sunburn I would like to save
That girl is like a sunburn I would like to save
She's like a sunburn, she's like a sunburn
