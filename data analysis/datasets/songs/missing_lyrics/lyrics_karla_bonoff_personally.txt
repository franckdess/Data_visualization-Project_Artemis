I've been writing letters everyday now
Since you've been gone
Talking to you on the telephone
For what seems like a whole life long
I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
I'm bringing it to you personally
I'm bringing it to you personally
There's nothing like the feeling I get
Oh when you touching me baby
There's nothing like the feeling you get
When I'm there with you, oh love
I've got something that the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
I'm bringing it to you personally
I'm bringing it to you personally
But I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
I'm bringing it to you personally
I'm bringing it to you personally
