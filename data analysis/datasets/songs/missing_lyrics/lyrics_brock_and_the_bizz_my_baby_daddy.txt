Why every time I call it's the same thing?
You have to be on the phone with Elaine
Or either Shawna, or Dawna
(T-Bird, lemme call you back, the phoneâ€™s for my mama)
When the phone click don't even try girl
Quit lying girl
You must think I'm stupid or either blind girl
Cuz something ain't right

The Bird say y'all was at the mall
(You a liar) You a liar
OK then, what his name? (Lavall)
Yesterday you said his name was Jay, so it ain't the same
It must be your new boyfriend
How come your best friend told me the dude's name was Ken? (Whatever)
You better get it together, cuz whenever you lie?
I'm like Mary J., I'm not gon' cry (Don't cry)
Hey, why don't you get up and get the door? (You get the door)

Now see, that's a perfect example
You know you ain't fittin' to go and get no pampers
Well, while ya at it, get some milk
If you don't hurry back, I'mma been done dipped
Oh baby, you can save the drama
Cuz I'm feeling going to see my baby mama

You 'bout to get fired, girl
Shut up and keep quiet, girl
I'm sick and tired of all your lying, girl
(T-Bird, I need some money for my baby)

(Yes T-Bird, it was)
That ain't my kid
(Yes it is your daughter)
I got one son
(You got a daughter, too)
I got a son named Chris and that's it
