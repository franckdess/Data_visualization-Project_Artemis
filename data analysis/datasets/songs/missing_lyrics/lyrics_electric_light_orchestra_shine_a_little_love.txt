Although the things you've done
I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see, I gotta make you understand
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter, baby
'Cause today's another day

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

Remember, tonight
We're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight
We're gonna say, we'll never stop
We got a good thing going on
I know you've heard it all before
But I really need you, darling
Every day, I need you more

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

Can you understand (yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right
(I know it is) Will you be the same
(I'll do it all again)
Hu, hu, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu-ha

It's been a year now
And it's getting so much better
You came home without a word
Though everybody said
You'll soon forget her
They couldn't see and
They just didn't understand
And looking in the mirror
There were fools at either hand

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

Can you understand (yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right
(I know it is) Will you be the same
(I'll do it all again)
Hu-ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hu-aah

How many days had I been
Waiting there to tell you
I really can't believe
We're walking out into the world tonight
We'll do it all again
Until the break of light
And the feeling in your heart
Will soon be shining in your eyes

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

You shine a little love on my life (Shine on me)
You shine a little love on my life (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
You shine a little love on my life (Shine)
You shine a little love on my life (E.L.O.)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
