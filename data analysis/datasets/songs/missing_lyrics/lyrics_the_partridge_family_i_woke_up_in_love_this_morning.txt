Last night
I turned out the lights, lay down and thought about you
I thought about the way that it could be
Two o'clock
Wonderin' what I'm doin' here alone without you
So I close my eyes and dream you here to me

And I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
Yes, I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind

Hello girl
Yes it's five o'clock, I know, but you just listen
There's something that I've got to let you know
This is you
This pillow that I'm huggin' and I'm kissin'
And one more thing before I let you go

And I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind

Do dreams come true?
Well if they do, I'll have you
Not just for a night
But for my whole life through

And I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
Now, I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind

I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
And, I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
