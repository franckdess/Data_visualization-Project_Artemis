Oh yeah
Round and round and round
Round, round
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah

Can you tell me where we're going to?
Can you tell me what it is we really want to find
Is the truth really there?
Or is it right under our hair?
For all we know
It's been there all the time

I say
Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say
Sitting idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're looking for still isn't found
I say
Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say
Sitting idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're looking for still isn't found

Can you tell me when we gonna get to it
I'm tired of fooling around
I said I want to do it
I learned my lesson young
I say
If you really want to have fun
Go for it and when you win
Say "I go for it"

One day
I'll make it in the big city
And I'll be looking for a girl who's pretty
One day
I'll make a play and she will say ok
'Cuz I plan to be a cool kitty

I say
Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams
I say
Sitting idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothing comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're looking for still isn't found
