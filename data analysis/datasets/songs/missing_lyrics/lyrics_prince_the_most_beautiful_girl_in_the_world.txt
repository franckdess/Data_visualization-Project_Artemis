It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl

And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cuz after you all one can do is die, oh

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower?
Oh, I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh yes, oh

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside
