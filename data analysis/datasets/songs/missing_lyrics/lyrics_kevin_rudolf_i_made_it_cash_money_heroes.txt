Yeah, Cash Money Heroes
Private Jets
Polished, Jay Sean, fly

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I’m livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!
Ooh, I made it
I made it, yeah
I made it, I-I-I made it!

Known from the city where no one believed in me
But I never give up the fight, yeah
But now on top I told you to let it rock (rock!)
The moneys fallin from the sky-y-y-y-y
I made it

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I’m livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!
Ooh, I made it
I made it
Yeah, YMCMB, baby
I made it, I-I-I made it!
Birdman, swagged out, 100

Rooftop, hella choppa burnin' smoke
Louie bag stay strapped wit a priceless globe
High life, flippin and get some more
Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When I hit, nigga, hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain, make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another 100, poppin' throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunna

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I’m livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!
Ooh, I made it
I made it (I made it!)
I made it, I-I-I made it!
Yo, ay ay ay, listen

See I don't live for glamour,and I don't care for fame
Im in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me then
Now they callin' my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I don gon platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is fallin' downnnnnn

I look up to the sky (damn, man)
And now the world is mine (mine!)
I've known it all my life
(Oh oh oh, whoa oh oh)
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I’m livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
(Oh oh oh oh!)
I made it, I made it!
(I look up to the sky!)
I made it
I made it (made)
I made it, I-I-I made it!

Came from the gutter, lookin like my motha
Made it to the goal line, straight out the huddle
Cash money goldmine, weezy stay loyal
Boy we getting money like we just found oil
Uh and thats word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bedrash
AndIjust tell em to loaf it when the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the World if I change hands
Uh it feel good to be here, Weezy in the building got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money

I look up to the sky (to the sky!)
And now the world is mine (the world is mine!)
I've known it all my life (all my life!)
