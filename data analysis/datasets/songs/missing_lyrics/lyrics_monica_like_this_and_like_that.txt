I just can't keep from going
I'm falling in love with you
I need to know if you want me for sure
We've messed around for too long
I need a commitment
To make me feel I belong to someone

So if you like to
Then this is your chance to
I'm moving on without you
Gotta find another, baby
You say you want me
Then you better show me
Come on and get to know me
And then you will find that

I want you (and I feel the same)
We ought to be sure, I know by now
But if we can't prove our love
Like this and like that, I'm gonna move along

Like this and like that (yeah)
Like this and like that (like this and like that)
Like this and like that (yeah)
Like this and like that, I'm gonna move along

You are very special to me
Don't want to lose you, no
I've gotten used to the way we hang out
No way to understand it
You said one day it will be
But I can't wait around to see

So if you like to
Then this is your chance to
I'm moving on without you
Gotta find another, baby
You say you want me
Then you better show me
Come on and get to know me
And then you will find that

I want you (and I feel the same)
We ought to be sure, I know by now
But if we can't prove our love
Like this and like that, I'm gonna move along

I want you (and I feel the same)
We ought to be sure, I know by now
But if we can't prove our love
Like this and like that, I'm gonna move along

I feel a whoop comin' on, cuzz
I feels a whoop comin' on, cuzz
I said whoomp there it was
Take the time to hold the kisses
As I dismiss this rhyme
It goes, engine engine, who's the Gemini
Well, it it's the Mr. and the Mrs., brothas and sistas it goes
Like that and like this as conflict explodes
It was one of those days not much to do
So-uh I strut to the mall just to buy a thing or two
And I met a wise guy playing a harmonica
By him was "Foxy Brown," go now
She says "I'm Monica"
Monica? Oh yeah, "Monica so she say"
Ay, I be the M-A-L-I-K
Excuse Miss Thang, my god you look smooth
Put away your loot!
You all in with me, boo
She said, "Oh no, cause I'm rather above you
Not to get on your nerves
But haven't you served a star or two?
Only the ones with no class, the ones with no shame
Shine on them
Like a diamond in the rain off the window pane."
It's written on your kitten
Can I slob it too?
Of course I got the sauce to put on the barbecue
Well if tonight is tonight like Betty Wright
Can I see you as a G, you know you out of sight
Well I say funny as it seems but I must reveal
You're the chocolate as you jock it with that sex appeal
Let's chill (let's settle down)
Come on, yeah, uh huh
Like this and like that, y'all
It's like that, y'all
It's like this, y'all
It's like that, it's like this, it's like that, y'all
I want you (like this and like that)
We ought to (like this and like that)
But if we can't prove our love
Like this and like that, I'm gonna move along

...this and like that
Like this and like that
If we can't prove our love...
I'm gonna move along

I want you (like this and like that)
We ought to (like this and like that)
But if we can't prove our love
Like this and like that, I'm gonna move along
