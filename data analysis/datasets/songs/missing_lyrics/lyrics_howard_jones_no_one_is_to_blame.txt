You can look at the menu
But you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions
But you can't have a seat
You can dip your foot in the pool
But you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment
But you can't commit the sin
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can build a mansion
But you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner
But you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules
And let you count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can see the summit
But you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle
But you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured
But you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds
But your hopes go down the drain
And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
