Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore
And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a shortcut
I'd have found it
But there is no easy way around it
Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer
Who knows why someday
We all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by
Tell me
Is it worth just another try
Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
(Let it shine)
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer
Tell me
Are we alive
Or just a dying planet?
(What are the chances?)
Ask the man in your heart
For the answer
And when you feel afraid
(Love one another)
When you've lost your way
(Love one another)
And when you're all alone
(Love one another)
And when you're far from home
(Love one another)
And when you're down and out
(Love one another)
And when your hopes run out
(Love one another)
And when you need a friend
(Love one another)
And when you're near the end
(Love, we got to love
We got to love one another)
Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer
Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
(Shine, shine, shine)
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer
Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer
Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
