I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me

I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around

Oh, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
My baby don't care
