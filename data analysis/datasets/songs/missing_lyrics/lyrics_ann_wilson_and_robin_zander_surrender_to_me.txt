Is it that we've been together much too long?
The answer may not be in black and white
We're always trying to prove who's right or wrong
Yet now we're giving up without a fight
But I know when you're gone
I'll wish I held on
So, baby, surrender to me
There'll be no holding back now
So, baby, surrender to me tonight
I don't want our love to cause you so much pain
If this is how it's going to be, I'll walk away
Oh, neither one of us should ever say goodbye
Let's forget about the past and who's to blame
'Cause when this is all gone
We'll wish we'd held on
So, baby, surrender to me
There'll be no holding back now
So, baby, surrender to me tonight
How could this love be in danger
That used to be so good, so right?
To think that fate could make us strangers
Has thrown me in your arms tonight!
So, baby, surrender to me
There'll be no holding back now
So, baby, surrender to me tonight
So, baby, surrender
