Boy you'll never find another love
As good as this
So ya better represent
'Cause my love is the shhh (the bomb baby)
Girl you'll never find another love
As good as this
So ya better represent
Cause my love is the shhh (the bomb baby)

You keep telling me on the telephone
How ya got it going on
And how you keep me satisfied (oh yeah)
But actions speak louder than words
I must see what I've heard
Is it true or do you lie?
'Cause I need somebody
Givin' nothin' but good lovin'
All through the night (oh yeah)
Someone to break me off a little somethin'
When I need to be satisfied
And I got one thing in mind

Boy you'll never find another love
As good as this
So ya better represent
'Cause my love is the shhh (the bomb baby)
Girl you'll never find another love
As good as this
So ya better represent
Cause my love is the shhh (the bomb baby)

All these things I say to you
I swear that they are true
I'm all you'll ever need (oh yeah)
Good love is so hard to find
And I won't waste your time
Satisfaction is guaranteed
I'll be the lover
That you need
To break you off in the middle of the night
I'll take a little trip downtown
I'll be the freak
You need in your life
And I'm knowin'

Girl you'll never find another love
As good as this
So ya better represent
Cause my love is the shhh (the bomb baby)
Girl you'll never find another love
As good as this
So ya better represent
Cause my love is the shhh (the bomb baby)

Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, get it
Let me work that body baby
Let me work that body baby
Let me work that body baby
Let me work that body baby
