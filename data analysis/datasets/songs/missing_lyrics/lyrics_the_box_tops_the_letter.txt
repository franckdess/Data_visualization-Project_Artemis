Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a goin' home
My baby jus' wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
I got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm a goin' home
My baby jus' wrote me a letter
Well, she wrote me a letter
Saying she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister can't you see
I gotta get back to my baby once more
Any way, yeah
