Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Don't know why you wanna jump on me
Baby, baby, baby
You're making me cry

Baby, I
I'm gonna find myself someone new
Someone who will be true
And no more toein' the line
I know it's over
Cause I see the signs
Don't let me waste your precious time
Baby
I'm tired of toeing the line
If you want to get rid of me
Baby, baby, baby
You're doing fine

Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes
And leave you far behind
You're rolling over
And over so divine
But you can't fix this broken heart of mine

Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
Baby
I'm tired of toein' the line
