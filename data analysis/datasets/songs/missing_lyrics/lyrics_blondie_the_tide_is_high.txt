The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no
It's not the things you do that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear till it's my turn
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one, number one, number one

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear till it's my turn
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one, number one, number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
