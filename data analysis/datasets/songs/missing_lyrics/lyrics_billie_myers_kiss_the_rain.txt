Hello, can you hear me?
Am I getting through to you?
Hello, is it late there?
Is there laughter on the line?
Are you sure you're there alone
'Cause I'm trying to explain?
Something's wrong
You just don't sound the same
Why don't you?
Why don't you go outside?
Go outside
Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the night's
As empty for me as for you
If you feel
You can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain, kiss the rain, kiss the rain
Hello, do you miss me?
I hear you say you do
But not the way I'm missing you
What's new? How's the weather?
Is it stormy where you are?
You sound so close but it feels like you're so far
Oh, would it mean anything
If you knew
What I'm left imagining
In my mind, my mind
Would you go? Would you go?
Kiss the rain
As you fall over me
Think of me, think of me
Think of me, only me
Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
If your lips
Feel hungry and tempted
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the nights
As empty for me as for you
If you feel
You can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Hello, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
