I don't need to fall at your feet
Just cause you cut me to the bone
And I won't miss
The way that you kiss me
We were never carved in stone
If I don't listen
To the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I am the king of wishful thinking

I refuse to give in to my blues
That's not how it's going to be
And I deny the tears in my eyes
I don't want to let you see
No
That you have made a hole in my heart
And now I've got to fool myself

I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

I will never, never
Shed a tear for you
I'll get over you
If I don't listen to the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I'm the king of wishful thinking
I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
But I won't shed a tear for you
I'll be the king of wishful thinking
I'll get over you
I'll pretend my heart's still beating
Cause I've got no more tears for you
I'm the king of wishful thinking
I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
