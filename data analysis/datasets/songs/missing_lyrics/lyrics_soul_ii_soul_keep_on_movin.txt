Don't stop like the hands of time

The time will come one day
Why do people choose to live their lives this way?

Keep on moving, don't stop, no

It's our time, time today
The right time is here to stay
Stay in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will surely come when
You'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays

I know the time, time today
Walking alone in my own way
Extremely cold and rainy day
Friends and I have fun along the way
Yes we do
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will really come when
You'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sunrays
