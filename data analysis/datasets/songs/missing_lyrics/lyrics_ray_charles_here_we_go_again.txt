Here we go again
He's back in town again
I'll take him back again
One more time

Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again (I will...)
One more time

I've been there before
And I will try it again
But any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
(Alright, Mr. Preston!)
I've been there before (and you know what?)
I will try it again

But any fool, any fool knows
That there's no, no way to win

Here we go again
She'll/He'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
I'll take her/him back again
One more time

(I will)
