She ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you

You make it hard for me to see somebody else
I'm calling her your name, yes, messed up
'Cause I'm thinking about you, it's your fault, babe
I never wanted us to break up, no, not this way
But you don't understand it, girl

When she touches me
I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her it's only about the sex
With you I had a bad romance

And if I could just trade her in I would
'Cause nobody can pass you up, no
Yeah, I think I better let her go, can't leave you alone
Everyday that I'm with her, all I want is you

I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
Now I realize that she ain't you
No, she ain't you

She ain't you
'Cause she ain't, no, she ain't you

I've been sleeping out for quite some nights now
It's not the same in my bed
But if she found out what's going on in my head
It will be all bad, have me right back
But you don't understand it girl

When she touches me
I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her it's only about the sex
With you I had a bad romance

And if I could just trade her in I would
'Cause nobody can pass you up, no
Yeah, I think I better let her go, can't leave you alone
Everyday that I'm with her, all I want is you

I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
And now I realize that she ain't you
No, she ain't you

No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you

No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she ain't, she ain't you
No, she

I think I better let her go, can't leave you alone
Everyday that I'm with her, all I want is you girl

I wanna leave but I'm afraid
That you don't even feel the same
Now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you

She ain't you
'Cause she ain't, no, she ain't you
