You can run, you can hide
Never let it inside
Keep living your life in the dark
Sooner or later
That gentle persuader is gonna catch up with your heart
Make you a dreamer
Believer
Believing in love
Right when a man's doing all that he planned
And he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver a shot that will shiver him
Driving him down to his knees
Make him start giving
Living
Living again
Well, it's your mind
That tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into staying where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Out of the blue
She reaches for you
And you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast
But you know it won't last
Cause you can't get her off of your mind
Thoughts are burning
Turning
They're turning around
How do you know when to stay or to go
And how do you know when it's real
You don't need a sign to make up your mind
You got your heart at the wheel
You wanna start sharing
Caring
Caring again
Well, it's your mind
That tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into staying where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Turn you around
