This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

A-this thing (This thing) called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (Woo, woo), it jives (Woo, woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat


I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love


Yeah
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike (Ah hum, ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
