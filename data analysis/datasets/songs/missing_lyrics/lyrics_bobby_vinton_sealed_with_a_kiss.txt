Though we've got to say
Goodbye for the summer
Baby, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Yes, it's gonna be a
Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But baby, you won't be there
I don't wanna say
Goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
So, let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
Yes, it's gonna be a
Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss (fade out)
