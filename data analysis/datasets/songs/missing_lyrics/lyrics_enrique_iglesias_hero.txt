Let me be your hero

Would you dance
If I asked you to dance?
Would you run
And never look back?
Would you cry
If you saw me crying?
Would you save my soul, tonight?
Would you tremble
If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?
Oh please tell me this
Now would you die
For the one you loved?
Hold me in your arms, tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear
That you'll always be mine?
Or would you lie?
Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away


Oh, I just want to hold you
I just want to hold you
Oh, yeah
Am I in too deep?
Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care
You're here tonight

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain (Oh yeah)
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero
