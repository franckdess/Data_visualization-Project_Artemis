Yeah yeah, DTP, how we do, call you, you can call me
Whatever you want to do baby, come on

Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank America
With my son cashin' a check
So I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark), I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off
Thinking 'bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (What she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you
Then I say

Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

Yo, yo
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin out, tryna dunk, tryna dribble
Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, Lil' Howard you weak'
But you know how that go
What I got they want, what I got I flaunt
Ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, "Yeah boo, I can't see me without you"
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said

Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you wanna roll, just)
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry be happy and smile

Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)
