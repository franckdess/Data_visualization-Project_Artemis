We're like summer and winter
We're not one bit alike
We're like satin and cinders
I'm definitely not your type
Well, then what are we doin' in love
What are we doin' in a mess like this
What are we doin' love
Why were you someone I couldn't resist
What are we doin' in love
We're like paper and matches
Well probably have our share of fights
We're like roses and switches
It's gonna be hard but we've got to try
Oh, what are we doin' in love
What are we doin' in love in a mess like this
What are we doin' in love
What are we gonna tell all our friends
You don't have to like someone to love someone
That rule was made to be broken
But if we have to say goodbye to a life we've gotten used to
What are we doin' in love then
We're like sun up and sun down
People say we're never gonna last
We're like uptown and downtown
You like it slow and I like it fast
So what are we doin' love
What are we doin' love in a mess like this
What are we doin' love
What are we gonna tell all our friends
You don't have to like someone to love someone
That rule was made to be broken
But if we have to say goodbye to a life we've gotten used to
What are we doin' love then
