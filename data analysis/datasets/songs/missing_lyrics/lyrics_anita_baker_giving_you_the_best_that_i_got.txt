Ain't there something I can give you?
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind
And make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach
The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together
We can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes, I tell you now
That I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me
Said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got

Listen, baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own
Now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone
I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got
Listen, baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got
Giving it to you, baby

Giving you the best that I got
