Hey!
(I want a Soldier!)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impala's around
(I got a Soldier!)
Wit' the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit' the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you tell 'em, "don't even try it"
To shoot it with 'Chelle, and kick it with Kelly, or holla at B
Ya', gotta be g's, you way outta your league
Please!

If his status ain't hood

Known to carry big things

Better be street if he looking at me

That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street

So quick to snatch up your Beyoncé (Beyoncé)
Always coming down popping our way (Our way)

Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D boy use to run into traps
Still a soldier, go to war if you running your trap
About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the waller
It's the reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like

Hey, see, Cash Money is a army
I'm walking with purple hearts on me
You talking to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem
Call him, Weezy F. baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't trying to hide
I blend in wit the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandanna tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute!
