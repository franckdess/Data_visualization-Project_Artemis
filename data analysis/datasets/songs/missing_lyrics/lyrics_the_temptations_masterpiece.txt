Where I was born, everything was dull and dingy
I lived in a place they called the inner city
Getting ahead, huh, was strictly a no-no
'Cause nobody cares what happens to folks that live in the ghetto

Thousand of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
This is a challenge just staying alive
'Cause in the ghetto only the strong survives

Broken down homes, kids strung out
They don't even know what life's all about
Stealin' cars, robbin' bars
Muggin', drugs, rat-infested and no one's interested

Kids dodgin' cars for recreation
Only adds to a mother's frustration
Break-ins, folks comin' home and findin' all their possessions gone
Oh ho

It's an every day thing - well well - in the ghetto
It's an every day thing in the ghetto
