I get up in the morning and I see your face, girl
You’re looking so good, everything’s in place
Don’t you know I could never leave your side, girl
Won’t you stay here with me and be my bride?

Don’t you know you’re my kind, you’re just what I like
Girl you’re everything, don’t you know you’re alright
The only girl I’ve always needed for so long

Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

When I look through the pages of a magazine
Still, your pretty face is the prettiest I’ve seen

Don’t you know I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do
You’re my everything

Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Bass! Alright
Oh, yeah, it’s out of sight
Let me say it’s alright
Ah, yeah!

Don’t you know I only want to be with you
No other girl could make me feel the way you do
You’re my everything

Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, she’s my cover girl
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, she’s my, she’s my cover girl

Oh yeah, yeah
Cover girl, please say you’ll stay
Oh yeah, cover girl
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, cover girl
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
