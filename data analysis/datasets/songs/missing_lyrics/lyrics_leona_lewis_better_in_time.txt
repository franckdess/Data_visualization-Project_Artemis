It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going, coming
Thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (oh, yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too (oh, yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be (and I know, and I know)
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will!

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really loved you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to, yes I do
It'll all get better in time
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too (yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really loved you
Gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
