Hey girl, what ya doing down there
Dancin' alone every night
While I live right above you
I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me
You don't even know me
I love you
Oh my darling

Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe if the answer is no
Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show

If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note
That's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
Only in my dreams did
That wall between us come apart
Oh my darling


I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me you don't even know me
I love you
Oh my darling
