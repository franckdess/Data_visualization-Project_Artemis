"Jack and Diane" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to "Keep On Rocking Me Baby"
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back
