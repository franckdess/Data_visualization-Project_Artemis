I'm in love with you girl cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true
Youâ€™re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear
Then delay my system when you are near
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world so try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true
