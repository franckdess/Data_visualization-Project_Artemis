I had a dream so big and loud 
I jumped so high I touched the clouds 
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)

I stretched my hands out to the sky 
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)

I'm never gonna look back, whoa
Never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now 

This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife 
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife

I howled at the moon with friends 
And then the sun came crashing in 
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)

But all the possibilities 
No limits just epiphanies 
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)

I'm never gonna look back, whoa
Never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now 

This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife

This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife 

I hear it calling outside my window 
I feel it in my soul (soul) 
The stars were burning so bright 
The sun was out 'til midnight 
I say we lose control (control) 

This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife 

This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be 
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now

This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife
