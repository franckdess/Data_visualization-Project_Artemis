We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand skeptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)

Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time, a lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Ah!

Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
