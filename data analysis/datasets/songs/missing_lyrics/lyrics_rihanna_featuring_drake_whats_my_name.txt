Uh, good weed, white wine
Uh, I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waitin' on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's gettin' hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gon' say

You got that somethin'
That keeps me so off balance
