Things haven't been the same since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise that I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reason why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along what I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret for me
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
