{Introductory Monologue}
The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East Africa was her neighbor
Across a short strait of sea miles
The great Egyptian age is but a remnant of the Atlantean culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis
Knowing her fate
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician
And the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice and let us sing
And dance and ring in the new
Hail Atlantis!
{Chorus}
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be

My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I wanna see you someday
My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
My antediluvian baby
My antediluvian baby, I love you, girl
Girl, I wanna see you someday
My antediluvian baby, oh yeah
I wanna see you someday, oh my antediluvian baby
My antediluvian baby, I wanna see you
My antediluvian baby, gotta tell me where she gone
I wanna see you someday
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
