Dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets

I caught you smiling
I know I've seen you here before
How come you're hiding
Hey, don't you wanna hit the floor?
The place is crowded
Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head
So let me take you somewhere else instead
Dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets

Grab your coat
And wave goodbye to your friends
I wanna take you
Where the night never ends
I feel the need
To sweep you off your feet
You and me
We should be dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets

We got the rhythm
We got the music on our side
If we go with 'em
I'll bet we'll have a wonderful ride
Ooh, oh
Your hands are cold
So maybe we could make some heat
Love is always born on a chance
So wrap around me
And baby, let's dance
Dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets

Dancing in the sheets
