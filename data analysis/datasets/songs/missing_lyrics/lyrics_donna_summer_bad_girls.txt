Bad girls, talking ’bout the sad girls
Sad girls, talking ’bout bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night
Picking up all kinds of strangers
If the price is right
You can score if your pocket’s nice
But you want a good time

You ask yourself
Who they are
Like everybody else
They come from near and far
Bad girls, yeah

Bad girls, talking ’bout the sad girls
Sad girls, talking ’bout bad girls, yeah

Friday night and the strip is hot (hot)
Sun’s gone down and they’re about to trot
Spirit’s high and they look hot
Do you wanna get down?

Now, don’t you ask yourself
Who they are
Like everybody else
They wanna be a star
Yeah, yeah, there comes

Bad girl, sad girl
You’re such a naughty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh

You bad girl, you sad girl
You’re such a naughty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh

Now you and me, we are both the same
But you call yourself by different names
Now your Mama won’t like it when she finds out
Girl, is out at night

Hey mister, have you got a dime?
Mister, do you want to spend some time, oh yeah
I got what you want, you got what I need
I’ll be your baby, come and spend it on me
Hey mister, I’ll spend some time with you
With you, you’re fine, with you

Bad girls, they’re just bad girls
Talkin’ about sad girls, yeah
Sad girls, yeah
Hey, hey mister, got a dime?
