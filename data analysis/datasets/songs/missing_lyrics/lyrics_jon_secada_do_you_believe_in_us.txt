I tremble inside
Just thinking
About the world around us
Scared, can't help to wonder
(Don't want any changes)
'Bout the way we feel
Do you know what I mean
(Catch me I'm falling)
Say it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us (us)
Just give it half a chance
Yes our love (love)
Will still be strong
Girl I believe in us (Girl I believe in us)
I'll give you all I can
Time has redefined the meaning
Love - the way we know it
Love - the way we show it
(I don't want any changes)
When it comes to you
I like us the way it is
(No matter what happens)
Say it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us (Yes I do)
Just give it half a chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl I believe in us (Girl I believe)
I'll give you all I can
I don't want any changes
Unless you want them to
Forever ain't long enough, baby
(Nothing can change us)
Say it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us (yes I do)
Just give it half a chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl I believe in us (Girl I believe)
I'll give you all I can
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us (Do you believe)
Just give it half a chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl I believe in us (Girl I believe in us)
I'll give you all I can
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us (Do you believe in us)
Just give it half a chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl I believe in us (Girl I believe)
I'll give you all I can
