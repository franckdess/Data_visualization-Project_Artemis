You've got a cute way of talking
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers
And I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead
I'm in a spin
You know
Shaking on a string
You know

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Ah

Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired
No, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight
And leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home
You put a spell on me
I'm right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing
Dancing
Dance the night away
Ah

And if you'll let me stay
We'll dance our lives away

You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
(I feel like dancing)
You make me feel like dancing
I wanna dance my life away
(I feel just like dancing)
You make me feel like dancing
