Baby's black balloon makes her fly
I almost fell into that hole in your life
And you're not thinking about tomorrow
Cause you were the same as me
But on your knees
A thousand other boys could never reach you
How could I have been the one?
I saw the world spin beneath you
And scatter like ice from the spoon that was your womb

Coming down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?

You know the lies they always told you
And the love you never knew
What's the things they never showed you
That swallow the light from the sun inside your room, yeah

Coming down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
Or are you someone's prayer?

And there's no time left for losing
When you stand they fall, yeah

Coming down the world turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I go on as you get colder
All because I'm
Coming down the year's turned over
And angels fall without you there
And I'll go on and I'll lead you home and
All because I'm
All because I'm
And I'll become
What you became to me
