Yeah
One, two princes kneel before you
That's what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
And that's some bread now
This one said he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head now

This one, he got a princely racket
That's what I said now
Got some big seal upon his jacket
Ain't in his head now
You marry him, your father will condone you
How 'bout that now?
You marry me, your father will disown you
He'll eat his hat now

Marry him, or marry me
I'm the one that loves you, baby, can't you see?
I ain't got no future or family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought to be

Said
If you want to call me "baby"
Just go ahead now
And if you like to tell me "maybe"
Just go ahead now
And if you wanna buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you would like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now
