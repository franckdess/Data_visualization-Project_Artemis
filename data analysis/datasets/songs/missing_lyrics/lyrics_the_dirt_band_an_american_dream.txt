I beg your pardon, mama, what did you say?
My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay
It's not that I'm not interested, you see;
Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be
I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go;
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
Keep on talking, mama, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear
I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go;
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
Voila! An American Dream
Well, we can travel girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign
Just keep talking, mama, I like that sound
It goes so easy with that rain falling down
I think a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear
Voila! An American Dream
Yeah, we can travel, girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign
Just think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go;
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
