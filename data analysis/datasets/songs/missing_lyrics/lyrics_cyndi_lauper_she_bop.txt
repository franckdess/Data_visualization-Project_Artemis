Well, I see 'em every night in tight blue jeans
In the pages of a Blueboy magazine
Hey, I've been thinking of a new sensation
I'm picking up the good vibrations
Oop, she bop, she bop

Do I wanna go out with a lion's roar?
Yeah, I wanna go south and get me some more
Hey, they say that a stitch in time saves nine
They say I better stop or I'll go blind
Oop, she bop, she bop

She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
(I hope He will understand)
She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu, she bop
Oh, she do, she bop

Hey, hey they say I better get a chaperone
Because I can't stop messing with the danger zone
I won't worry, and I won't fret
Ain't no law against it yet
Oop, she bop, she bop

She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
(I hope He will understand)
She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu, she bop
Oh, she do, she bop
She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
(I hope He will understand)
She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu, she bop
Oh, she do, she bop
