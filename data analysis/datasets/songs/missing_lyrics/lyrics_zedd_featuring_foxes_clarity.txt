High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain i
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'till it breaks your glass a
And I drown in you again
'Cause you are, the piece of me
I wish, I didn't need
Chasing, relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
If our love, is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's, insanity
Why are you my clarity?
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
If our love, is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's, insanity
Why are you my clarity?
Walk on through a red parade, a
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes you
Us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'lld choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep a
And I'll fall right back to you
'Cause you are, the piece of me
I wish, I didn't need
Chasing, relentlessly
Still fight and I Dont't know why
If our love, is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's, insanity
Why are you my clarity?
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
Why are you my clarity?
(Clarity-Clarity-Clarity)
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
Why are you my remedy?
(Remedy-Remedy-Remedy)
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
Why are you my clarity?
(Clarity-Clarity-Clarity)
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
Why are you my remedy?
(Remedy-Remedy-Remedy)
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
If our love, is tragedy
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's, insanity
(Eh, Eh, Eh-Eh-Eh)
Why are you my clarity?
