I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Yeoaw!
Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela
(Rock!) And Pamela
(Rock!) And Samantha
(Rock!) And Amanda
And Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, "Bitch, what's up?"
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Ruling rock rubbin' rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder

And I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time
