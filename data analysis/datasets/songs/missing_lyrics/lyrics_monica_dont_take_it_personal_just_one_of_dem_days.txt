It's just one of them days when I wanna be all alone
It's just one of them days when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong
I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave
And baby, trust me please

Just one of them days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal
I see and I think about every thing we do
And I find myself in misery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really want to be with you the whole way through
But the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back from mood to mood it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love?
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me, boy
So baby, don't you leave

Just one of them days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal
Just one of them days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal
Just one of them days
Just one of them days
Just one of them days a girls goes through
Don't take it personal
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't take it personal
Don't take it personal, yeah , don't take it personal

Don't take it personal baby
Personal baby, personal baby, personal baby
Personal baby, personal baby
