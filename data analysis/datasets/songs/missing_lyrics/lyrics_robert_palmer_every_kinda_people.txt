Said the fight to make ends meet
Keeps a man upon his feet
Holding down his job
Trying to show he can't be bought
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
Every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Someone's looking for a lead
In his duty to a king or to a creed
Protecting what he feels is right
Fights against wrong with his life
There is no profit in deceit
Honest men know that
Revenge does not taste sweet
Whether yellow, black or white
Each and every man's the same inside
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
You know that love's the only goal
That could bring a peace to any soul
Hey, and every man's the same
He wants the sunshine in his name
Ooh, it takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
Mmm, every kinda people
To make what life's about
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
