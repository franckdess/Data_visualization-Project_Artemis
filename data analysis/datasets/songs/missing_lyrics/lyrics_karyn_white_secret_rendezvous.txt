Happiness is when I, I think of you
And when we get together and rendezvous
I'll be on time, you bring the wine
And when we lock the door, you'll be all mine

Alone in my room
Thoughts of you in my head
As I wait
The time is soon
You'll arrive
Together then
We'll escape

Into the night on wings of love
And do the things that we once dreamed of
All aboard a luxury
A first class ticket to ecstasy

It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous
It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh

From a penthouse view
We'll make love
Drink champagne by candlelight
I'm so glad I'm in your arms
Baby, I am yours tonight

To be with you is all I need
So lock the door and throw away the key
No one will disturb this groove
We could not stop it if we wanted to

It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous
It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh
Secret rendezvous
Happiness is when I, I think of you
And when we get together and rendezvous
I'll be on time, you bring the wine
And when we lock the door, you'll be all mine
I want you
Do you want me?
I wanna lock the door
Throw away the key
Ecstasy, yeah

(It won't stop)
No
(It don't stop)
Baby
(Our non-stop secret rendezvous)
(It won't stop, it don't stop)
I just wanna be with you
(Our non-stop secret rendezvous)

It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous
(Oh-ooh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh, oh-oo-oh, secret rendezvous)

I wanna rendezvous by candlelight
I wanna hug and squeeze you through the night
So lock the door, throw away the key
Ecstasy
I can't let no one disturb this groove
I couldn't stop it if I wanted to
It's you for me
And me for you
In a secret rendezvous
(Oh-ooh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh, oh-oo-oh, secret rendezvous)

It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous
It won't stop
It don't stop
Our non-stop secret rendezvous

I wanna rendezvous by candlelight
I wanna hug and squeeze you through the night
So lock the door, throw away the key
Ecstasy
I can't let no one disturb this groove
I couldn't stop it if I wanted to
It's you for me
And me for you
In a secret rendezvous
(Oh-ooh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh, oh-oo-oh, secret rendezvous)
