Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Oh wow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (Uh-oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Uh-oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Uh-oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? (Oh-oh)

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (Uh-oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Uh-oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Uh-oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show (Uh-oh)
Really had me going
Now it's time to go (Uh-oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Uh-oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
