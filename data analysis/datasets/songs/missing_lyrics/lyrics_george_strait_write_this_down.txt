I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time
'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure


You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone

Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go
Baby, write this down
