Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sipâ€”dot com
Now I gotta word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a rap, ASAP

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah


Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'
Let's get it, let's get it
I know you got the good feelin'
Let's get it, let's get it
Gotta love the life that we livin'

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I
Never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, oh, sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah
