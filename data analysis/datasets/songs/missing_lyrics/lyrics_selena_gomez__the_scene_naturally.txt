How you choose to express yourself
It’s all your own, and I can tell it comes naturally
It comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It’s intuitive, you don’t have to try, it comes naturally
Mmm, it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder, and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally when you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (You know it does)
It comes naturally  (Mmm, yeah)

And it takes my breath away (Every time)
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder, and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally when you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby

When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away
You are!

You are the thunder, and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally when you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby

Naturally, naturally, naturally, naturally, naturally
Ba-ba-baby
Naturally, naturally, naturally, naturally, naturally
Everything, baby, comes naturally
Naturally, naturally, naturally, naturally
