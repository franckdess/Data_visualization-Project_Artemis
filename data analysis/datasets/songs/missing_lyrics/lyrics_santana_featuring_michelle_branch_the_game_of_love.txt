Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss
And boom, you're the only one for me

So please tell me why
Don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm cryin'
Outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love

It's whatever you make it to be
Sunshine instead of this cold lonely sea
So, please, baby, try
And use me for what I'm good for
It ain't saying goodbye
It's knocking down the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me, control me, console me
Please hold me
You guide me, divide me into one
Ooh

So please tell me why
Don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm dying
Outside the door of your loving store

It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
It's all in this game of love
It's all in the game of love
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
Let's play the game of love

Roll me, control me, please hold me
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
Make me feel good, yeah
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
Now here on my own, on my own
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
