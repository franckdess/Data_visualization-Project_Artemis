I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and
Closer to you, closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you
