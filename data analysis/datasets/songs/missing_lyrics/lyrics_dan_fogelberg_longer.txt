Longer than
There've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there`ve been
Stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
Stronger than
Any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than
Any forest primeval
I am in love with you
I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We`ll fly through
The falls and summers
With love on our wings
Through the years
As the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines
In the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks
And the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you
Longer than
There`ve been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than
There`ve been stars up in the heavens
I`ve been in love with you
I am in love with you
