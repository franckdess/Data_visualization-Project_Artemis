I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love

Never stopping
I was always searching for that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love

Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not what this love's all about
Our love is here to stay, stay

Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love
