Take a good look at it, look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a go 'round
I'll let you touch it if you'd like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route
Don't go too fast, don't go too slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control

Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

I know that you want me
I can see it in your eyes (Haha)
You might as well be honest
Cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll, I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast just let me know
Cause it means you move too slow
I like some excitement and I like a man that goes

Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

If you want me (If you want me) let me know it (Let me know)
I'll make time but you've got to show it (You've got to show)
If you need me (If you need me) I want to see (I want to see)
But don't mistake me
I don't want you down on your knees
I need someone (I need someone) a real man (A real man)
I need someone who understands (Who understands)
I'm a woman (I'm a woman) a real woman (A real woman)
I know just what I want
I know just who I am

Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours, all yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light
