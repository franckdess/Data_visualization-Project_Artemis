Oh...
Remember...
Oh, I remember...
I wanna know...
Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I screamed I hated you
But somehow deep inside still loving you
Sad and lonely
No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be
But you made me leave
And plus my heart it just, it just kept telling me so


There was nowhere else to go, oh
Nobody else to turn to, no
For the rest of my life, I promised myself I will love me first genuinely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
So sad and lonely, hey
I remember when I stormed out
I remember when I gave up loving you
I was sad and lonely
