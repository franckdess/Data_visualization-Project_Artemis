Mmm, oh yeah, oh what a night

Oh yes, it's ladies' night
And the feeling's right
Oh yes, it's ladies' night
Oh what a night (Oh what a night)
Oh yes, it's ladies' night
And the feeling's right
Oh yes, it's ladies' night
Oh what a night

Girls, y'all got the one (What?)
A night that's special everywhere
From New York, to Hollywood
It's ladies' night, and girl the feeling's good


Romantic lady, single baby
Uhmm, sophisticated mama
Come here you disco lady
Yeah, stay with me tonight

If you hear any noise
It ain't the boys
It's ladies' night
Gonna step out ladies night
Steppin' out ladies night
Gonna step out ladies night
Steppin' out ladies night


On disco lights your name will be seen
You can fulfill all your dreams
Party here, party there, everywhere
This is your night, baby
You've got to be there, well

This is your night
Tonight, everything is gonna be alright

Come on let's all celebrate
