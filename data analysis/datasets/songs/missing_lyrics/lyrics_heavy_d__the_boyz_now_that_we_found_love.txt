Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up my little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not, here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hug pro
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch stretch for a sec
Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck
Shake me, shake me baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am come on and take me
Wind your body baby move your body
I see you slip sliding come on and do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling hunky–dory about this thing that I found

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

I like the way you wiggle you don't jingle, but you jiggle
So spread open your love cause it's Heavy in the middle
Move it like a mover she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we played school and I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb) But not like this
We can toss and turn, rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax, lover, my lady
Lady lover, my baby girl
Spread your wings so we can fly around the world
Harmony, charming me your fingertips are calming me
When you dropped the kisses, Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me
Stretch it, stretch it, flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission okey-dokey I'll bless it
Bless it like buddha, buddha has to bless
We can lay down after loving put your head on my chest

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

What can we do what are we gonna do
Roses are red and violets are blue
Love is good and plenty if you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss you where you're hot give what I got to keep you bubblin'
Do me right, do me right my lonesome dove
Tell ya man one time what is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feelin' hunky–dory about this thing I found

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

Here we go, keep it funky
Put your hands together, y'all come on
Bring it back one time
All up in money earning Mount Vernon
This one's dedicated to you
Know what I'm saying
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
The whole New York City
I said I love ya to death
And ya don't stop
Ya don't quit, ya gotta keep on
Until the d-d-do it like this
Ya don't stop, ya don't quit
Ya gotta keep on and on and on
Yeah
Alright
Oh yeah
