She keeps a MoÃ«t et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Pa-pa-pa-pa)
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime


Drop of a hat she's as willing as, playful as a pussy cat
(Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive (Drive you wild, wild)
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?
