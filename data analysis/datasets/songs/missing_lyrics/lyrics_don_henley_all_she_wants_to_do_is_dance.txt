They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance
Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance
But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance
They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, "Don't come back here, Yankee"
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money
'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance
