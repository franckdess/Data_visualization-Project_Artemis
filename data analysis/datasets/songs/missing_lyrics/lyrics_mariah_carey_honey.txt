Oh honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there (Uh huh)
And you're the only one who makes me come runnin'
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare, oh

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you, honey (I like that)
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you (yeah)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey (honey)

It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya (I need you bad)
One hit of your love addicted me (Ooh, your love addicted me)
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?  (I can't wait for another)
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

How good it feels inside (Gotta have another taste)
Harlem world, we won't stop
So Mariah, take us higher
Honey I can't describe (I gotta have you now, come on baby)
Harlem world, we won't stop (I need your honey right now)
How good it feels inside
