Once I said I wanted you
I don't remember why
I often wonder if it's true
That you could make me cry
I only know it's long ago
You said "I love you" too
But I got one solution left
We're gonna start anew
How do you do, mm-hmm
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you
And then we can na-na, na-na
Just like before
And you will say na-na, na-na
Please give me more
And you will think na-na, na-na
Hey, that's what I'm livin' for
How do you do, ooh-hoo
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you
And then we can na-na, na-na
Just like before
And you will say na-na, na-na
Please give me more
And you will think na-na, na-na
Hey, that's what I'm livin' for
Once I said I wanted you
And I remember why
I often wonder why it's true
You still can make me cry
And now it's not so long ago
You said "I love you" too
'Cause I had one solution left
And that's to start anew
How do you do, mm-hmm
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you
And then we can na-na, na-na
Just like before
And you will say na-na, na-na
Please give me more
And you will think na-na, na-na
Hey, that's what I'm livin' for
How do you do, uh-huh
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you
And then we can na-na, na-na
Just like before
And you will say na-na, na-na
Please give me more
And you will think na-na, na-na
Hey, that's what I'm livin' for
How do you do, ooh-hoo
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la
Hey, that's what I'm livin' for
How do you do, aha
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la
