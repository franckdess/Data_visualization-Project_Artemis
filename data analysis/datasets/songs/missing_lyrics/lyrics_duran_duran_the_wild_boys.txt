Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys
Wild! Boys!

The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell
Pre-Chorus
They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always, wild boys
