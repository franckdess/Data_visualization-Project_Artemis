I like this right here, yeah
Bad Boy, and we won't stop
Faith, '99

1 - 	We can dance, dance, dance
	Clap your hands, hands, hands
	All night, if you're in the mood
	Do what you wanna do
	All night long
Happy days are here
So leave your cares behind
Just relax your mind
It's so easy to do it
Just enjoy  yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's all right
Ain't nothing but a party
Repeat 1
Get up on the floor
Don't worry 'bout a thing
The rhythm's got you now
So come on, get into it
Just enjoy yourself
If the feeling's right
Get your groove on tonight
Take your time tonight
Everything's all right
Ain't nothing but a party
Repeat 1
Have a good time
Lay back, relax
Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If it's a hot then I must've did it
If it's not then I wasn't with it
Bad Boy stay committed
Whether hip-hop or R&B
Featuring Faith Evans, co-starring me, P. Diddy
You know I got the key to your city
Unlock the door, rock some more
Beats we lace
Bad Boy heat the place
We run R&B too cuz we keep the faith
Givin the streets a taste
Blaze the charts

I remember

In case you forgot
First Lady B making it hot
Ain't nobody taking the spot
Now it's Faith instead of pain
Coming through with a better grain
In the dash, cell phone better range
Get the cash, and stock paper for the whole four quarters
Damn, some things never change
Can ya feel me? Ya feel me? Let's make 'em dance
Let's go
Repeat 1
Have a good time
Lay back, relax
Just free your mind
Let the music take control of you
Repeat 1 until fade
