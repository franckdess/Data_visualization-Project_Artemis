So tired, tired of this drama
You go your way, I go my way
No more, no more
I wanna be free
I'm so tired, so tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee that I'll be fine

(No more pain), no more pain
(No more pain), no more pain
(No drama), no more drama in my life
(No more in my life), no one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool?
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

(No more pain), no more pain, no more pain
(No more), no more game
No more game messin' with my mind (no drama)
No more drama in my life (no more in my life)
No one's gonna make me hurt again
No more (no more tears)
No more tears, I'm tired of cryin' everynight
(No more fears), no more fears, I really don't wanna cry
(No drama), no more in my life (no more in my life)
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind
Go 'head

Ooh, it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (free from all the pain)
Free from all the game (free from all the pain)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

(No more pain), no more pain, no more pain, tired of hurting
(No more pain), tired of your playin' games with my mind
(No drama), no more drama in my life (no more in my life)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
(No more tears), no more tears, no more cryin' every night
(No more fears), no more waking me up in the morning
With your disturbing phone calls (no drama)
Leave me alone, go ahead (no more in my life)
Hey, yeah
Oh, whoa (no more pain)
No more time (no more games)
No more games, I'm tired, I'm so tired (no drama)
No more, no more (no more in my life)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more

No more drama
I'm tired of all this drama (no more drama)
Go 'head, go 'head, you demons get out of my face (no more drama)
Go get out my life (no more drama)
I am 'bout to lose my mind
Lord, help me, help me say
No more drama (no more drama)
No more drama (no more drama)
No more drama (no more drama)
No more drama
Oh, help me sing, I need a peace of mind
No more drama (a peace of mind, peace of mind)
Damn, I need a good night sleep (no more drama)
I need to know that you won't creep

Oh no, oh no
No more, no more, no more drama
No more drama, in my, in my... life
I'm so tired (I'm so tired, so tired)
Tired, tired of all this drama
Of all the drama
