As my life goes on I believe
Somehow something's changed
Something deep inside
Ooh, a part of me
There's a strange new light in my eyes
Things I've never known
Changing my life
Changing me

I've been searching
So long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning

Now I see myself as I am
Feeling very free
Life is everything
Ooh it's meant to be
When my tears have come to an end
I will understand
What I left behind
Part of me


Searching
Don't you know I'm hell yeah
For an answer
To the question
Oh yeah
For our minds
Baby
Baby it's true
It's only natural
It's only natural baby, yeah
Good things
In life
Take a long time
Yeah yeah
