Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
My baby, she wrote me a letter
I don't care how much I've got to spend
I'm gonna find my way, my way back home again
Oh the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
My baby, she wrote me a letter
She wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen to me, mister, can't you see I've gotta
See my baby once more?
Anyway
I don't care how much I've got to spend
I'm gonna find my way back home again
Oh the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
My baby, she wrote me a letter

She wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen to me, mister, can't you see I've gotta
See my baby once more?
Anyway
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
My baby she wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
