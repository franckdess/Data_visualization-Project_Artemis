I didn't ask
They shouldn't have told me
At first I'd laugh, but now
It's sinking in fast
Whatever they've sold me
Well baby I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you
It gets hard
The memory's faded
Who gets what they say
It's likely they're just jealous and jaded
Well maybe I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you
I can't let it get me off
Or break up my train of thought
As far as I know, nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you
Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in
Til we're talking about it, not stepping around it
Maybe
I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you (won't take advice from fools)
Ooh (I'll figure everything is cool)
Until I hear it from you (won't take advice from fools)
Ooh (I'll figure everything is cool)
Until I hear it from you
