Went to a party the other night
All the ladies were treating me right
Moving my feet to the disco beat
How in the world could I keep my seat
All of a sudden
I began to change
I was on the dance floor acting strange
Flapping my arms
I began to cluck
Look at me
I'm the disco duck

Ah, get down mama
I've got to have me a woman
Ha ha ha ha ha

Disco, disco duck

Got to have me a woman

Disco, disco duck

Oh, get down, mama

Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco

All right

Disco disco duck

Ah, get down, mama
Oh mama, shake your tail feather
Ha ha ha ha ha

When the music stopped
I returned to my seat
But there's no stopping a duck and his beat
So I got back up to try my luck
Why look it's the disco duck!

Everybody's doing the

Disco, disco duck
Disco, disco duck
Try your luck

Wave to me

Don't be a cluck

I'm so happy to be here

Disco

Thank you, duck

Disco

For getting down

Disco disco disco

Thank you so very much

Disco duck

You're welcome

Disco
Disco Duck
Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco, disco, disco
