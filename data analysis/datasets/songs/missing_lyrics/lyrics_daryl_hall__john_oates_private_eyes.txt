I see you, you see me
Watch you blowing the lines when you're making a scene
Oh, girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks the senses will show
To my heart, when it's watching for lies
You can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you

You play with words, you play with love
You can twist it around, baby, that ain't enough
'Cause girl, I'm going to know
If you're letting me in or letting me go
Don't lie when you're hurting inside
'Cause you can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move, baby
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you


Why you try to put up a front for me?
I'm a spy but on your side, you see
Slip on into any disguise
I'll still know you, look into my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
