Dark clouds are blowing in the wind
He's crossing your mind again
You've got that sad, sad feeling, from a broken heart
Feeling so close to the end
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
When you find out how good love can be
You're so lost when it sets you free
They say once in your life you find someone that's right
Someone who loves you like me
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
When the moon has forgotten what the night's about
And the stars can't work their places out
Hold me tighter than tight
When the daylight comes it'll be alright
Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
