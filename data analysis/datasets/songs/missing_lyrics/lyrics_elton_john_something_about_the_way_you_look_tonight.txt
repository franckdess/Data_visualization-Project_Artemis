There was a time I was everything and nothin' all in one
When you found me, I was feelin' like a cloud across the sun

Well, I need to tell ya how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight, you just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty, I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Oh, takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
(The way you look) Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
