Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend
In my time of need
So I, I'm calling you now, just to make it through
What else can I do?
Don't you hear my plea
Friends may come and friends may go
But you should know that
I've got your back, it's automatic
So never hesitate to call
Cause I'm your sista and always for ya
And I

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or If I win
I know one thing that never changes and
That's you as my best friend

Whenever I'm down, with all that's going on
It's really going on
Just one of those days to ya
You say the right thing, to keep me moving on
To keep me going strong
What else can I say?
Friends are there through thick and thin
Well I've been told that
And I believe that it's automatic
Call me when you need a friend
Cause I'm your sister and always for ya
And I don't know
 (x2)
I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or If I win
I know one thing that never changes and
That's you as my best friend
Buddy, I can always call on my best friend (x2)

I'll be there for you
When you're going through
Times that you may think that you need a friend
You can count on me
Call me when you need
Won't you call me up? Cause I
(2x)
I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end

Through the good times and the bad ones

I know one thing that never changes and
That's you as my best friend
