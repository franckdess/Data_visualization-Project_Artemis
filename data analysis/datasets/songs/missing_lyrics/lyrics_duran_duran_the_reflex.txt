You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh woah
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh woah
Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
The reflex is a lonely child, who's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
I'm on a ride and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out
So, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
Why don't you use it?
The reflex is a lonely child, he's waiting in the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves an answer with a question mark, play
So, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it
The reflex is a lonely child who's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
And every little thing the reflex does
Leaves me answered with a question mark
Oh, the reflex, what a game, he's hiding all the cards
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
