Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't want to give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down

Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made our mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all
At all

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind

Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away

Do we separate, oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax
