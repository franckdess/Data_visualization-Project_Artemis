Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight (hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Gotta have love tonight (hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love
Lookin' for hot love


Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot

How's about some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'?
I need some hot stuff baby, tonight
Gimme a little hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Hot love, baby
Gonna need your love tonight (hot stuff)
I need hot love
Lookin' for hot love
Wanna have hot love

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out, no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialled about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home

Gonna have some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
Lookin' for my hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Need some lovin', baby, gonna need your love tonight
Hot stuff Hot stuff

Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot
Gonna have some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
