Instant Karma's going to get you
Going to knock you right on the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon you're going to be dead

What in the world you thinking of
Laughing in the face of love?
What on earth you tryin' to do?
It's up to you, yeah you!

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Going to look you right in the face
You better get yourself together, darling
Join the human race

How in the world you gonna see
Laughing at fools like me?
Who on earth d'you think you are?
A superstar? Well right you are!

Well we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well we all shine on
Every one, come on

Instant Karma's going to get you
Going to knock you off your feet
Better recognize your brothers
Every one you meet

Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear?
Why on earth are you there when you're everywhere?
Come and get your share!

Well we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well we all shine on
Every one, come on
Yeah yeah, alright, ah haa, aaaahh

Well we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
On and on and on on and on
Well we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah we all shine on
