(I'm sorry)
(I'm Sorry)
It's like I missed a shot
It's like I dropped the ball
(Damn I'm Sorry)
It's like I'm on stage
And I forgot the words
(Damn, I'm sorry)
It's like building a new house
With no roof and no doors
(Damn, I'm sorry)
It's like trying to propose
And I ain't got the ring
(Oooh damn I'm sorry)
But girl I've apologized
A million times before
(I'll apologize a million more)
So here it comes again
For all the wrong I've done
(so get ready babe)
Here's One million one

Girl this is my sorry for, 2004
And I ain't gonna mess up no more, this year
I'm 'a take this one chance
And make it real clear
I'm sorry for May
And I'm sorry for June (for real)
And I'm sorry for July (i am)
In case I dont tell you
August, September, October, November 'till your December
I'm Sorry
(I'm sorry 2004)
Its like stayin' out at night
Had way too much to drink
(Damn, I'm sorry)
It's like you change your hair
And I dont say a thing
(Damn I'm sorry)
It's like we're fallin' fast asleep
With no kiss, and before we hit
(yeah I'm sorry)
And It's like I forgot your gift
On 02 14 03
(Damn! So sorry!)
But girl I've apologized
A million times before
(I'll apologize a million more)
So here it comes again
For all the wrong I've done
(so get ready babe)
Here's One million one

Girl this is my sorry for, 2004
And I ain't gonna mess up no more, this year
I'm 'a take this one chance
(I'm 'a take my time)
And make it real clear
I'm sorry for May
And I'm sorry for June (for real)
And I'm sorry for July (i am)
In case I dont tell you
August, September, October, November 'till your December
I'm Sorry
(I'm sorry 2004)

I'm sorry for the way that I did you
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart for how I hurt you girl
I'm sorry on the weekends, sorry on the weekdays
Sorry for the things I did, Sorry for the things I said
Sorry for the lies
Sorry for the time
That I didn't get you what you want
That I didn't get you what you like
What can I do to tell you that I'm sorry babe
(sorry, sorry)
Oooooooooooooohhhhhhh! 
Wooooooooh!
All them strip clubs
All them hot tubs
I'm gone give them up
Cause I dont want to lose your love
