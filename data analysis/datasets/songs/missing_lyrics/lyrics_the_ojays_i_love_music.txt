Ah, ah, ah, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Ohhh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh
Get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, yeah
Ohhh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh
I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving
Makes me laugh, makes me smile all the while
Whenever I'm with you, girl
While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do
Oooh, oooh, oooh.  Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw
Ohhh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oooh, oh, oh, oh
I love music
Sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringing
I'm so happy to be in complete harmony
I love you, girl
And to hold you so close in my arms
I'm so glad that you're mine, all mine
Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet, so sweet
So mellow, mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arms
Oooh, honey I love you, I love you, yeah
Music is the hearing force of the world
It's understood by every man, woman, boy and girl
And that's why, that's why I say (That's why, that's why)
I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving, grooving
Music makes the atmosphere so fine
Lights down low, just me and you, baby you know
'Specially when you got a cold glass of wine
Mellow, mellow wine and song
I love music
Any, any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's grooving
And I say I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Sweet, sweet music.  (Keep it grooving.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Listen, listen, listen
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music, music
(Sweet music, sweet music.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Funky, funky music
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
Boogie, boogie.  (Groovy, oooh, oooh, groovy now.) Boogie
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
(We can dance all night long now.)
Any, any, any kind of music, music
I love, I love music, music.  I love.  (Sweet, sweet music.)
Na, na, na, na, na, na.  (Ahhh, ah, ah, ahhh.)
No, no, no, yeah, yeah.  (Keep it grooving.)
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love music
(Instrumental break)
Come on.  (Get it on.) Get it on
Come on, come on.  Get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
(Get on down.) Get it on
Come on, come on, come on, get it on
(Groovy, groovy, groovy sound.)
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
