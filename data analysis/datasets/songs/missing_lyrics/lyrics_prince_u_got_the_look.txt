Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look

You walked in, I woke up
I never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
You got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me taken' aback
Crucial, I think I wantcha

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

Look here

You got the look
You got the look
You must'a took
You must'a took
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected
Everybody's inspected
But you are a natural beauty unaffected
Unaffected
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected
I stand corrected

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

There's no girl to do
Well here we are
Ladies and gentlemen
The dream we all dream of
Oh, please!
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
Slammin'!

You walked in
I walked in
I woke up
You woke up
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough, baby
Baby
You got that look
Yes you do, yes you do
Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback
Baby
Crucial, I think I wantcha

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If your love is good, let's get to rammin' now
You got the look, you got the look

Here we are folks!
The dream we all dream of!
