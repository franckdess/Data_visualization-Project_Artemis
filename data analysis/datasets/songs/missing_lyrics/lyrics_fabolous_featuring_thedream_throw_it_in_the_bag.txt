Y'all know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need, she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop
(Just throw it in the bag, bag)

You know we had to go shopping one more time, right?
I think we forget somethin, haha, haha
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I said if you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag

It's Mr. "Throw It In The Bag", I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it cost but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I ain't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front, I'm a buy her what she want
Cause your queen 'posed to get what she desire, what she want
If my lady like to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch, she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this green, she the fire to my blunt
You can try her if you want, bet it's gon' cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They sayin it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't got to worry 'bout her she fine
My Player Card's approved, you niggas declined, NICEEE!!

Well alright
Loso, and Drizzy baby
Uh uh, we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say "come again"
Honestly she's probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If her card declined, you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah, just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband 'til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's her baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in '86
Yeah, she say she lucky that she his
No, I'm lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isssss

Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean lookin right
And you can't put a price on something lookin right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's lookin like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm bookin flights
If I want it, I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And that's on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Ain't A Thang Jay-Z, J.D
Like Jay-Z's lady, it's Beyoncein
Supportin your women goes beyond payin
Watchin me ball is like LeBRON playin
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see KanYe in
