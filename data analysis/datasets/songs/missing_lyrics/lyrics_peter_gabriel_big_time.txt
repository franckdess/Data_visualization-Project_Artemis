"Hi there"

I'm on my way, I'm making it
I've got to make it show, yeah
So much larger than life
I'm going to watch it growing

The place where I come from is a small town
They think so small, they use small words
But not me, I'm smarter than that
I worked it out

I've been stretching my mouth
To let those big words come right out
I've had enough, I'm getting out
To the city, the big, big city
I'll be a big noise with all the big boys
There's so much stuff I will own
And I will pray to a big god
As I kneel in the big church

Big time
I'm on my way, I'm making it
Big time
Big time
I've got to make it show, yeah
Big time
Big time
So much larger than life
Big time
I'm going to watch it growing
Big time

My parties have all the big names
And I greet them with the widest smile
Tell them how my life is one big adventure
And always they're amazed

When I show them round the house, to my bed
I had it made like a mountain range
With a snow-white pillow for my big fat head
And my heaven will be a big heaven
And I will walk through the front door

Big time
I'm on my way, I'm making it
Big time
Big time
I've got to make it show, yeah
Big time
Big time
So much larger than life
Big time
I'm going to watch it growing
Big time

Big time
My car is getting bigger
Big time
My house getting bigger
Big time
My eyes getting bigger
Big time
And my mouth
Big time
My belly's getting bigger
Big time
And my bank account
Big time
Look at my circumstance
Big time
And the bulge in my big, big, big
Big, big, big, big
Big, big, big, big
Big, big, big, big
