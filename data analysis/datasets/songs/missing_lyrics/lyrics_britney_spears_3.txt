1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves... ooh
Counting
1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3
Counting
1, 2
Counting
1, 2, 3

Babe, pick a night to come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?
Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing
Yeah, are you in?
I am counting

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves... ooh
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves... ooh

Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?
Let's make a team
Make them say my name
Loving the extreme
Now are you game?

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing
Yeah, are you in?
I am counting

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves... ooh
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves... ooh

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothing meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it, you and me
You and me, or three
Or four, on the floor

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves... ooh
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
