Thrown like a star in my vast sleep
I open my eyes to take a peep
To find that I was by the sea
Me gazing with tranquility

It was then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Came singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Came singing songs of love

"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang


Histories of ages past
Unenlightened shadows cast
Down through all eternity
The crying of humanity

It is then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Comes singing songs of love
Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Comes singing songs of love

"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy
Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang


"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
Here comes the Roly Poly Man and he's singing songs of love
"Roly poly, roly poly, roly poly, poly", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
{In various live appearances}
When truth gets very deep
Beneath a thousand years of sleep
Time demands a turn around
And once again the truth is found
Yeah, George
Awakening the Hurdy Gurdy Man
Who comes singing the songs of love
Beatles were Hurdy Gurdy Men
They came singing you songs of love
I am the Hurdy Gurdy Man
I come singing the songs of love
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
"Hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, hurdy gurdy, gurdy", he sang
