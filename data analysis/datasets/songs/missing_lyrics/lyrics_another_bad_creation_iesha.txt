RoRo:
Iesha, Iesha so glad to meetcha
See you in the schoolyard, strollin' wit your teacha
The lil skirt you played was really fly
She turned around and she winked her eye so I
Stepped to her like I knew her
The Biv is cool but Romell is cooler
The bell rang cuz I started to talk yet the class is not there no more
(Yo Red, where'd you meet her?)
Red:
At the playground, ya know
That's where I saw this cutie
This girl was swingin' and she looked so fly
On the monkey bars, we climbed up to the top and
She touched my hand that's when I fell in love
Chris:
Iesha..
You are the girl that I neva had
And I want to get to know you bettah
Iesha..
You know I want you so bad
And there's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you
Mike Bivins:
Yo Dallas man these five young boys out of Atlanta GA are a real mental
They kinda like remind me of me and my boys New Edition, know what I'm saying
So all you people out there ridin' in your cars listening to the radio station
Or cold maxin' in ya living room watching this here video, check the 2nd verse
We played Nintendo
This was her very first date
I didn't wanna make it seem to fly
We ate cereal
She couldn't stay out at late
Her mother told her to be home at nine
Chris:
Iesha..
You are the girl that I neva had
And I want to get to know you bettah
Iesha..
You know I want you so bad
And there's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you
Break

Yo Ro u might sound to sure so wutcha gonna do?
I dunno Da, I only got one more rap and I'm gonna see what happens
Threw down my books went up to the door
Pressed the bell what was in store?
Iesha came out with a smile (oh no)
She ain't worth the while
So I passed her a lollipop and a letter
Told her so let's keep this a secret
No remember Iesha, only u can peep this, peace
