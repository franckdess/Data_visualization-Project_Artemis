When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
