I walk along the city streets, you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be
Oh, how can I forget you, girl, when there is
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

When shadows fall, I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Oh, how can I forget you, girl, when there is
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me 

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just go back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there
Oh, how can I forget you, girl, when there is
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me 'cause there is
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
