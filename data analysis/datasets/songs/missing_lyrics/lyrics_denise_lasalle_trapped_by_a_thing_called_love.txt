Somebody tell me, what has this man got
He makes me feel what I don't want to feel
Somebody tell me, what has this man got
He makes me give what I don't want to give
On solid ground, I feel myself sinking fast
I grab a hold but I don't think it's going to last
I'm slowly losing my ground, slowly sinking down
Trapped by this thing they call love, oh, baby
(Hooked on this thing called love)
(Hooked on this thing called love)
Somebody tell me, what has this man got
He makes me cry, Lord, I don't want to cry
Somebody tell me, what has this man got
He makes me lie when I don't want to lie
He calls me up and I tell 'em to say that I'm not in
Then I cry all night if he doesn't call again
I'm slowly losing my ground, slowly sinking down
Trapped by this thing they call love, oh, baby
I'm slowly losing my ground, slowly sinking down
Trapped by this thing they call love, oh, baby
(Hooked on this thing called love ...)
I'm trapped, I can't help myself
I'm hooked on you baby, I just can't help myself
I can never be happy loving no one else
Oh, baby
Ooh baby
