Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day

As through time, the earth moves under my feet
One step closer to make love complete
What has the final say?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise

And so time over time
What will change the world?
No one knows (No one know)s
So the only promise is a day to live, to give
And share with one another

See the wisdom from mistakes in our past
Hear the younger generation ask
Why do I feel this way?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day (A new day)
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day (The promise)
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
We can make it better, baby

So time over time
What will change the world?
No one knows (No one knows)
So the only promise
Is a day to live, to give
And share with one another

Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day

As through time, the earth moves under my feet
One step closer to make love complete
What has the final say?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
Don't promise me
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day

See the wisdom from mistakes in our past
Hear the younger generation ask
What has the final say?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day

Eagle's calling and he's calling your name
Tides are turning, bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way?

The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
Why do I feel this way?
