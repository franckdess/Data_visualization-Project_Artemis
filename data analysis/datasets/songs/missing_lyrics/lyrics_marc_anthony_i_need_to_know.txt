They say around the way you've asked for me
There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I wanna hear
But that's just talk until you take me there

If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

Because I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know
I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know

My every thought is of this being true
It's getting harder not to think of you
Girl, I'm exactly where I wanna be
The only thing's I need you here with me

If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

Cause I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know
I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know

If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

Cause I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know
I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know

If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know
Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go

Cause I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know
I need to know, I need to know
Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know
