All through the night
I'll be awake, and I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying, so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh, under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

Oh, the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there awhile

We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
