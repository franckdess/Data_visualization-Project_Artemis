Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
Lawman has put an end to my running, and I'm so far from my home
Oh Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long
(Yeah!)

The jig is up, the news is out
They finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
This'll be the end today
Of the wanted man

Oh Mama, I've been years on the lam and had a high price on my head
Lawman said, "Get him dead or alive." I was for sure he'll see me dead
Dear Mama, I can hear you a-cryin', you're so scared and all alone
Hangman is comin' down from the gallows, and I don't have very long

The jig is up, the news is out
They finally found me
The renegade who had it made
Retrieved for a bounty
Nevermore to go astray
The judge will have revenge today
On the wanted man

And I don't wanna go, no, no

Hey, hey
No, no, no, I can't go
