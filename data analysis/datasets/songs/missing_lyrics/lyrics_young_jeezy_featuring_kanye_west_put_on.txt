I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city

When they see me off in traffic they say "Jeezy on some other shit"
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership
Me, I'm in my spaceship, that's right, I work for NASA
This FNH is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
"Call that bitch your bodyguard?" Yeah, that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate?
If you want it, come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm working out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah, I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait

I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

Hat back, top back, ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super-sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flying down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

I put on, I put on, I put on
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city
On

I feel like it's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like it's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know he's stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say, "Damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more?"
"You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me"
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely
I ain't lyin
So lonely, I ain't lyin!
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashing lights (flashing lights)
Cause every night, every night, I put on

I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

Let me see what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights
Cause every night, every night
Let me see what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite
I see those flashing lights
