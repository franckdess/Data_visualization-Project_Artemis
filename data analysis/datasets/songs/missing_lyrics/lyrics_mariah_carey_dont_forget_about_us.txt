(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
I bet she can't do it like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
