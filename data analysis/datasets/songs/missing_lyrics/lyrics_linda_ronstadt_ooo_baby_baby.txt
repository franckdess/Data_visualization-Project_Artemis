Ooo la la la la
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
And in came I lost you
What a price to pay, I'm cryin'
Ooo baby, baby
Ooo baby, baby
These days
I know I made you feel bad
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too, I'm cryin'
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
I'm just about at the end of my rope but I can't stop tryin'
I can't give up hope, 'cause I'll be here
And someday I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you, until that day is here, I'm cryin'
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo
