Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
What you're thinking of me
I can see it
Face is glowing
I can see in your eyes
I'm happy you know it

That you're having my baby

You're the woman I love
And I love what it's doing to ya

Having my baby

You're a woman in love
And I love what's going through ya
The need inside you
I see it showin'
Whoa, the seed inside ya
Baby, do you feel it growing
Are you happy you know it
That you're

Having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doing to me

Having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me

Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put ya through it
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No, you wouldn't do it

And you're having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doing to me

Having my baby

I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me

Having my baby
(Having my baby)
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me

Having my baby
(having my baby)

I'm a woman in love
And I love what's going through me
