I remember when Mary Lou
Said, "you want to walk me home from school?"
Well, I said, "yes, I do"
She said, "I don't have to go right home
And I'm the kind that likes to be alone some if you would"
I said, "me, too"
And so we took a stroll
Wound up down by the swimming hole
And she said, "do what you want to do"
I got silly and I found a frog
In the water by a hollow log
And I shook it at her and I said, "this frog's for you"
She said
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you
Well, I think of that girl from time to time
I call her up when I got a dime
I say, "hello, baby"
She says, "ain't you cool"
I say, "do you remember when?
And would you like to get together again?"
She says, "I'll see you after school"
I was shy and so for a while
Most of my love was touch and smile
Till she said, "come on over here"
I was nervous, as you might guess
Still looking for something to slip down her dress
And she said, "let's make it perfectly clear"
She said
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you
