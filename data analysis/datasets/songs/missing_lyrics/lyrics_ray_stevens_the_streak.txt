(Reporter):
Hello, everyone, this is your action news reporter with all the news that is news across the nation, on the scene at the supermarket. There seems to have been some disturbance here. Pardon me, sir, did you see
What happened?
(Witness):
Yeah, I did. I's standin' overe there by the tomaters, and here he come, running through the pole beans, through the fruits and vegetables
Nekkid as a jay bird. And I hollered over to Ethel
I said, "Don't look, Ethel!" But it's too late, she'd already been incensed
(Chorus)
Here he comes, look at that, look at that
There he goes, look at that, look at that
And he ain't wearin' no clothes
Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
Look at that, look at that
Fastest thing on two feet
Look at that, look at that
He's just as proud as he can be of his anatomy
He goin' give us a peek
Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
Look at that, look at that
He likes to show off his physique
Look at that, look at that
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around

This is your action news reporter once again, and we're here at the gas station. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?
(Witness):
Yeah, I did. I's just in here gettin my tires checked, he just appeared out of the traffic. Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't have nothin' on but a smile
I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin' her a cold drink
I hollered, "Don't look, Ethel!" But it was too late. She'd already been mooned
Flashed her right there in front of the shock absorbers
(Chorus)
He ain't crude, look at that, look at that
He ain't lewd, look at that, look at that
He's just in the mood to run in the nude
Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
Look at that, look at that
He likes to turn the other cheek
Look at that, look at that
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique
