Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away
Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today?
Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done?
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep)
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooo
Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess your leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now, you wanna be free
Well, I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
And don't come crying to me
When you're the lonely one
Remember what you've done
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooohooo
We don't talk
But I ain't losing sleep, no
I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho
We don't talk
Ahaha, we don't talk
