From Atlanta, Georgia
To the Gulf Stream water
Up to Califor-ni-ay
I'm gonna spend my life a-both a-night and day
And say

(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
Hey, you know it's alright, child, now
Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright
(Huh, huh-huh, huh, huh-huh, huh, huh)

To the girl in 'Frisco
To the girls in New York
To the girls in Texarkan'
You gotta understand that baby I'm your man
And say

(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
Hey, you know it's alright, now, now
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright)
(Huh, huh-huh, huh, huh-huh, huh, huh)

(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
Hey, you know it's alright, now, child
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright)
Hey, you know it's alright, child, now

(Gimme, gimme good lovin' every night)
(Gimme, gimme good lovin' make it alright)
