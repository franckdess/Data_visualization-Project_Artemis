I met a girl down at the disco
She said "Hey, hey, hey, yeah let's go
I could be your baby, you can be my honey
Let's spend time, not money
And mix your milk with my Coco Puffs
Milky, milky coco
Mix your milk with my Coco Puffs
Milky, milky right"

They say I'm really sexy
The boys they want to sex me
They always standing next to me
Always dancing next to me
Tryna feel my hump, hump
Looking at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it
If you touch it, I'ma
Start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama
No, no, no, no drama
So don't pull on my hand, boy
You ain't my man, boy
I'm just tryna dance, boy
And move my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
