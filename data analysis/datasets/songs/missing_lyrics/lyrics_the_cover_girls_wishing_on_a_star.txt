I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows
That I see
I wish on all the people
Who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow
Praying it'll come
And I'm wishing on all the lovin'
We've ever done
I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments
That we spent
I just can't let you go
For me, you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you
But I know
That in the game of love
You reap what you sow
I feel it's time
We should make up, baby
I feel it's time
For us to get back together
Make the best of things
Oh, baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time
We should make up, baby
I feel it's time
For us to get back together
Make the best of things
Oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
Oh woh woh, ooooooo, ooooo
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows
That I see
I wish on all the people
We'll never be
And I'm hoping on all the days to come
And days to go
And I'm hoping on days of
Lovin' you so
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
(Follow where you are)
I'm wishing on a star, oh oh
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
Oooo, oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Wishing on a, wishing on a, wishing on a)
Wishing on a star
Ooo. to follow where you are
(Wishing on a, wishing on a, wishing on a)
Wishing on a star
I'm wishing
Ooooo, ooooooooo
(Wishing on a, wishing on a, wishing on a, wishing on a star)
(Wishing on a, wishing on a, wishing on a)
Wishing on a star
