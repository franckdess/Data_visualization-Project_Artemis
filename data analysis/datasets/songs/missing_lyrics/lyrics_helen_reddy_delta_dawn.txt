Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
She's forty-one and her daddy still calls 'er "baby"
All the folks 'round Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with her suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say
He was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
