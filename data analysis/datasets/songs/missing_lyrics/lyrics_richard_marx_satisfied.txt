Yeah, yeah
Whoa
We work our bodies weary
To stay alive
There must be more to living
Than nine to five
Why should we wait for some better time?
There may not even be a tomorrow
Ain't no sense in losing your mind
I'm gonna make it worth the ride
Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?
Ignore the hesitation
That ties your hands
Use your imagination
And take a chance
Won't let my moment of truth pass me by
I've gotta make my move, now or never
And if they turn me loose on this town
They're gonna have to hold me down
Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?
Yeah
Don't you know
Ain't gonna stop up until we're satisfied?
Don't you know
We shouldn't stop until we're satisfied?
Yeh, yeah
Don't you know
Ain't gonna stop until I'm satisfied? Yeah
Don't you know
We won't give up until we're satisfied?
Oh, oh, oh
Why should I stop before I'm satisfied? Ow
