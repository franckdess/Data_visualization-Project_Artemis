I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants pay for it all
They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far

My Maserati does 185
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I'm attacked

I'm making records, my fans they can't wait
They write me letters, tell me I'm great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call
Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
Everybody, say I'm cool
He's cool!
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far


I go to parties sometimes until 4
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, I haven't changed
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
Everybody, say oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
I keep on goin', guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh oh
Here comes a flock of wah-wahs!
(Wall of wah-wahs)
