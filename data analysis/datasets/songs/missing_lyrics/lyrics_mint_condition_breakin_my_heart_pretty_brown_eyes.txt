Pretty brown eyes

Pretty brown eyes
You know I see you
It's a disguise the way you treat me
You keep holding on
To your thoughts of rejection
If you're with me you're secured
You keep telling me
That your time is always taken
But I keep seeing you out alone
Listen to love
Your heart is pounding with desire
Waiting to be unleashed

Quit breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart

Don't tell your friends
That I don't mean nothing to you
Please don't deny the truth
Tell me right now
I know your heart is in the right place
You know I won't let you down
You can't disguise
All the pounding of your heart
I see your eyesÂ  and you can't hide
Start to make sense
And quit playin these love games
Tell me what you're gonna do


Pretty brown eyes
Pretty brown eyes
I just wanna know one thing
Will you be with me?
Pretty brown eyes

Here comes my darling
Here comes romance
Here comes my love
And please honey will you dance
