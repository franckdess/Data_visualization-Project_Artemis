If I could be you
And you could be me
For just one hour
If we could find a way
To get inside
Each other's mind, mm-hmm
If you could see you
Through my eyes
Instead of your ego
I believe you'd be
Surprised to see
That you've been blind, mm-hmm

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse
Criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now, your whole world
You see around you
Is just a reflection
And the law of karma
Says you're gonna reap
Just what you sow, yes you will
So unless
You've lived a life
Of total perfection
You better be careful
Of every stone
That you should throw, yeah

And yet we spend the day
Throwing stones
At one another
'Cause I don't think
Or wear my hair
Same way you do, mm-hmm
Well, I may be
Common people
But I'm your brother
And when you strike out
And try to hurt me
It's hurtin' you, Lord have mercy

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse
Criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

There are people
On reservations
And out in the ghettos
And brother, there
But for the grace of God
Go you and I, yeah, yeah
And if I only
Had the wings
Of a little angel, yeah
Don't you know I'd fly
To the top of the mountain
And then I'd cry, hey

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse
Criticize and accuse
Better walk a mile in my shoes
(Drop what you're doin')
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Uh, before you abuse
Criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes, yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse
Criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
