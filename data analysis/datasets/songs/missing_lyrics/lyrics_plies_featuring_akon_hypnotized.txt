(Intro) (Plies)
Hey whats happening homie
This lil boy plies man
I ran across a nice lil babe the other day homie
Lil mama so bad she had me hypnotized
Couldn't even get my eyes out off her
Imma tell you how it feels to be hypnotized
(Chorus) (Akon)
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping tities just bouncing up and down
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping tities just bouncing up and down
(Verse 1) (Plies)
Its 2 o'clock in the morning
Im yait up and im horny
All I need now is some moaning
That pussy got me zoned
O fine tell me she wanted
She got it fuck how she on me
I got it now cause she jonning
I know in the apanan she phone me
Im locked down as that monkey
I know she wet cause she told me
That ass on her she talking
Every nigga in here stobing
I see me up and im pocking
She bend over and im stroking
Her cheeks spread wide open
I been there and im focus
(Chorus) (Akon)
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping tities just bouncing up and down
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping tities just bouncing up and down
(Bridge X2) (Akon)
Now do it some more (just like that), just do it some more (ya just like that)
Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash)
(Verse 2) (Plies)
She bad as hell and she swoll
Im tryn to play and I hold
Lil mama down, she cold
I fuck her ones and shes sold
I want her naked, no clothes
Im in the private shows
No limits everything goes
Imma let her ride me on her toes
Just stand on front of me and pose
You touch mine I touch yours
Then get all strong as mine goes
First time I seen her I froze
I had to get her she know
She worked then she fall
Cause im too real and she know
She want the goon and then show
(Chorus) (Akon)
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping tities just bouncing up and down
You got me so hypnotized the way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping tities just bouncing up and down
(Bridge X2) (Akon)
Now do it some more (just like that), just do it some more (ya just like that)
Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash)
