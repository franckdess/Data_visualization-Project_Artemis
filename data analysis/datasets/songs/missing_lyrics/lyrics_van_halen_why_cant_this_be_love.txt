Oh here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey I don't know
Ooh tell me where to begin
Cause I never ever
Felt so much

And I can't recall
Any love at all
Baby this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love
Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love

I tell myself
Hey only fools rush in
Only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned ifI'll get
Hung up on the line

No I can't recall
Anything at all
Baby this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love
You want it straight from the heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love


It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love
Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love
Baby why
Can't this be love
Got to know why
Can't this be love
I wanna know why
Can't this be love
