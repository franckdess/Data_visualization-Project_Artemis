Let me see your body rock
Shakin' from the bottom and top
Freak to what the DJ drop
We be the ones to make it hot (to make it hot)
Electric shock, energy like a billion watts
Space be booming, the speakers pop
Galactic comb and Mr. Spock
We bumping in your parking lot

Parking lot
When you comin up in the spot
Don't bring nothin' we call P. Dot
Cause we burning around the clock
Hit the lights and then turn them off
If you bring that don't make you stop
Like the jungle, we run the block
No-one rolling the way we rock, way we rock

I wanna rock right now
I wanna, I wanna rock right now
I wanna, I wanna rock right now

I wanna da-, I wanna dance in the lights
I wanna ro-, I wanna rock yo' body right
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride

Rock that body, c'mon c'mon, rock that body (Rock yo' body)
Rock that body, c'mon c'mon, rock that body
Rock that body, c'mon c'mon, rock that body (Rock yo' body)
Rock that body, c'mon c'mon, rock that body

You could be the model type, skinny with no appetite
Short, stacked, black or white, long as you do what you like
Body outta sight, body, body outta sight

She does the two step, and the tongue drop
She does the cabbage patch, and the bus stop
She like electro, she love hip-hop
She like the reggae, she feel punk rock
She love samba, and the mambo
She like to breakdance, and calypso
Get a lil' crazy, get a lil' stupid
Get a lil' crazy, crazy, crazy

I wanna da-, I wanna dance in the lights
I wanna ro-, I wanna rock yo' body right
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride
Hop in the music and rock yo' body right
