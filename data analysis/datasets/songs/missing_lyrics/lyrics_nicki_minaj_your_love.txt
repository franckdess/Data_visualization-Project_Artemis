Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of 
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me "Mama", "Lil' Mama", I call him "Baby"...

Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Mm-hmm... yo... yo...
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon,
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...

Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Find me in the dark, I'll be in the stars;
Find me in your heart - I'm in need of your love...
Your love... your love, your love...
Baby, you're the illest...
Your love...

Your love...
