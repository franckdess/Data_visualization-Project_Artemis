Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
One at a time, baby
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)

I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we'll be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm are?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm are?)

Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

So listen baby girl
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

Yeah my money ain't aloof like Phil and them
And it's really not quite low as LSN
Your body ain't Pamela Anderson
It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan
But listen baby girl
Before I let you lose a pound, I'll buy a bigger car
So listen baby girl
I love you just the way you are, the way you are

Oh, baby, it's all right, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out till we get it right

Can you handle me the way I are
I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
