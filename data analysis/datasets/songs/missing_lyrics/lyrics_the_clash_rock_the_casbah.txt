Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top
The Sheikh he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grille

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

The king called up his jet fighters
He said "You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way"
As soon as the Shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed

Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

(Shareef don't like it)
Thinks it’s not kosher
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Fundamentally can’t take it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
You know he really hates it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Really, really hates it
