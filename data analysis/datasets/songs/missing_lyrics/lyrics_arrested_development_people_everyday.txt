Hey, alright, hey, alright
Yo this is headliner from the arrested development
And right now you have missed out our celebration
Celebration of life death the destroying of our ancestors
Let me hear you say wow, wow
Say yay yay
Say wow wow yay yay wow yay wow yay...
Wow wow say yay say wow wow yay yay
Wow wow yay yay wow yay wow yay...

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear 
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me

I am everyday people
I am everyday people

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

I am everyday people
I am everyday people

The moral of the story is you better look very hard at who you're stepping to, 'cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it
Hey, you know it, you know it, you know it, you know it, hit it!
Africans need to be loving each other and unite
