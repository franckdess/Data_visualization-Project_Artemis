Kind of a drag
When your baby don't love you
Kind of a drag
When you know she's been untrue
Oh, listen (listen to me when I'm speaking cause you know the words I'm thinking)
To what I've gotta say (and I know that you've been cheating, oh, I hope that that we'll be meeting)
Girl, I still love you (ooo, I still love you)
I'll always love you (ooo, I'll always love you)
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Kind of a drag
When your baby says goodbye
Kind of a drag
When you feel like you wanna cry
Oh, girl (listen to me when I'm speaking cause you know the words I'm thinking)
Even though you made me feel blue (and I know that you've been cheating, oh, I hope that that we'll be meeting)
I still love you (ooh, I still love you)
I'll always love you (ooh, I'll always love you)
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
Oh, listen (listen to me when I'm speaking cause you know the words I'm thinking)
To what I've gotta say (and I know that you've been cheating, oh, I hope that that we'll be meeting)
Girl, I still love you (ooo, I still love you)
I'll always love you (ooo, I'll always love you)
