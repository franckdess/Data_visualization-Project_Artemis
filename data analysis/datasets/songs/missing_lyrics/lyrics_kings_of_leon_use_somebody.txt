I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you

Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody

I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now


Someone like you
Somebody
Someone like you
Somebody
Someone like you
Somebody

I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
