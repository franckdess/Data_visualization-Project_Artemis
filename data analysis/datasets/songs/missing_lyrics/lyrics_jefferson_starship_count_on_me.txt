Precious love, I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep
In the eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face, you make me feel
Light on the stairs and lost
In the air of a love so real
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
To see you through
Emerald eyes and China perfume
Caught on the wheel and lost
In the feel of a love so soon
Ruby lips, you make my song
Into the night and saved by
The light of a love so strong
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
To see you through
Woo hoo hoo hoo
You can count on me, girl
(Count on me)
You can count on my love
(Count on my love)
Precious love, I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep
In the eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face, you make me feel
Light on the stairs and lost
In the air of a love so real
You can count on me
Count on my love
Count on me
Count on my love
