When I was a little boy (When I was just a boy)
And the Devil would call my name
I’d say, “Now who do
Who do you think you’re fooling?”
I’m a consecrated boy
Singer in a Sunday choir
Oh, my mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rock me like the rock of ages
And she loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
When I was grown to be a man
And the Devil would call my name
I’d say “now who do
Who do you think you’re fooling?”
I’m a consummated man
I can snatch a little purity
My mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rock me like the rock of ages
And loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me
And If I was the President
And the Congress called my name
I’d say “now who do
Who do you think you’re fooling?”
I’ve got the presidential seal
I’m up on the presidential podium
My mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
And she loves me like a rock
She rock me like the rock of ages
And love me

She love me, love me, love me, love me, love me like a rock
She love me love me like a rock
Love me, love me, love me love me like a rock, oh baby...
She love me, love me, love me, love me...
