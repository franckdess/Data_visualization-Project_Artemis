My first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist

I said no more teachers and no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers, hoping that nobody looks
Lips like liquorice, tongue like candy
Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...

My first kiss went a little like this

I said no more sailors and no more soldiers
With your name in a heart tattooed upon their shoulders
Kisses like whiskey, it gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it (Ohh)

She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...

My first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist

(Yeah) She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....

She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say
