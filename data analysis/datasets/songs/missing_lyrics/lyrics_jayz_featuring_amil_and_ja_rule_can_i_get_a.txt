Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough

You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that
How we gonna get around on your bus pass
Before I put this pussy on your mustache
Can you afford me? My niggas breadwinners, never corny
Ambition makes me so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nothing, baby boy, you better
Get up, get out and get some, shit
I like a - lot of Prada, Aliz√© and vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down e'rytime it pop up, huh
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya
Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My - coochie remains in a Gucci name
Never test my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance
High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass
If you ain't holdin' I dash yo

Can I get a fuck you

It ain't even a question
How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my puss wet and they don't dry like damp clothes
What y'all niggas don't know: it's e-asy to pimp a hoe
Bitches better have my money fo' sho'
Before they go runnin' they mouth, promotin' how
I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin' 'em feel slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em, "be gone"
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num
'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the i-con
With hoodies and Timbs on, 'cause I thugs my bitches
VV studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggas
I'm talkin' 'bout straight figures, if you here, you with us
If not, Boo, you know what, I still fucked you

Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
