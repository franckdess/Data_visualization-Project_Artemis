Well, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me
I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no
Don't you know you can tell everyone that we're through
You might even believe it too
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me
I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down
So you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
You'll see sweet darling, there's ain't no getting over me
No, no, no, no, No Darling, there ain't no getting over me
Ooooh mmmm
Mmmm No darling, there ain't no getting over me
Ooooh darling, there ain't no getting over me...
