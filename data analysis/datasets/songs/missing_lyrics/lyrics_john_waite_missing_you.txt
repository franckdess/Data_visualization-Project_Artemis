Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you

Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what I might say
(Missing you, missing you)

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say
(Missing you, missing you)

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
I keep lying to myself
(Missing you, missing you)

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends say

Ain't missing you
(Missing you)
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
(Missing you)
Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no
(Missing you, missing you, missing you)
No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing you
(Missing you)
