Yeah, yeah yeah
Popcorn
Some like them fat and some like them tall
Some like them short, skinny legs and all
I like them boss, I like them proud
And when they walk, you know they draw a crowd
See, you got to have a mother for me
Yeah, yeah yeah
Popcorn, looka here
There was a time when I was all alone
I had a secret, thought I was gone
Somebody dug me, said, now I see
What you are doing, brother, to stay ahead of me
But when I get burnt, ha, I use a salve
And when I want loving, a mother she got to have
See, you got to have a mother for me
Yeah, popcorn
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

OW, OW, popcorn

Looka here, ha, good God
Looka here
Do the popcorn and do the horse
Show everybody where you're at, you gotta be boss
When you do your little thing, step in a small ring
And jump back, baby, James Brown's going to do his thing
