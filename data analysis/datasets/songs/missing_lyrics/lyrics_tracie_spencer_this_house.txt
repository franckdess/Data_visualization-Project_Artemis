Where do we go from here?
What must we do to make that change?
It's time to understand
Understand one another

In a world so cold
A place of disbelief
Where will the people go
Without enough to eat?
Let's not give up hope
We have to find a way
Search within our soul
To make a better day

This house is our house
Let's do it for the people
It's all in the hands of love
This house is their house
Let's give it back to the people
The people of the world today

I see hurt in their eyes
I hear the sounds of voices cry
It's time to open our eyes
Time to help one another



You, me
We can make the difference
And you know
No one
No one likes to be alone, yeah
We got to face it heart to heart
We have to make a brand new start
We got to change the tears to smiles
We have to go the extra mile
It's time we face reality
To give them hope and set them free
I think it's time we say goodbye
To all the homeless people's cry
We got to face it heart to heart
We have to make a brand new start
We got to change the tears to smiles
We have to go the exta mile
(You, me)
It's time we face reality
(We can make the difference)
Give them hope and set them free
I think it's time we say goodbye
To all the homeless people's cry
(And you know)

We've got to take the time
To search the mind to find
This house, our house
(It's all in the hands of love)
(I said it's all in the hands of love)

Let's do it
Let's do it for the people
This house
Let's give back to the people
The people of the world today
Do it for the people
This house
Give back to the people, yeah
It's all in the hands of love
