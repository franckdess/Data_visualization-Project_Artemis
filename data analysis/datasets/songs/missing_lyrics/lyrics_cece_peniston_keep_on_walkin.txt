You can just... walk on
You can just go, walk on, keep on
You just go, walk on, keep on
Sittin', waitin', anticipatin'
Waitin' for your call
Tossin', turnin', my heart's burnin'
From the things I saw
I'm sorry baby
You can't play me
I just can't be used
I'm so fed up
Time to get up
Baby, we are through
I though that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood
Keep on walkin'
I ain't talkin to ya anymore
You can just go on
Keep on walkin'
Keep on walkin'
I ain't talkin to ya anymore
You can just go on
You can just go on
Keep on walkin'
Keep on walkin'
Go on baby
Go on go on baby, yeah
You, you can just...
Walk on you
You can just... keep on
I thought I told ya
It was over, why are you confused?
You made your choices
Now I'm voicin' my opinion on you
I think you're crazy to try
To play me for a foolish girl
You'll soon discover
You're not the only lover in this world
I though that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood
Keep on walkin'
I ain't talkin' to ya anymore
Go on
Keep on walkin'
You can just go
Walk on, keep on
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You can just go
Ooh ooh ooh
You can just go
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
