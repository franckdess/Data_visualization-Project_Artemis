This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

He said "I fought two wars
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damned if I know"
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet"

But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy
