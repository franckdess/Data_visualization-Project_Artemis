Please love me forever
Don't forget me ever
Just listen to my plea
Please don't stop loving me
You're in my dreams nightly
Don't take my love lightly
Begging on bended knee
Please don't stop loving me
Oh, when I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord your love I'll keep
If I should die before I wake
I'll come back for you
That's no mistake
Oh, I'll love you forever
Can't forget you ever
Our love was meant to be
Please don't stop loving me
I'll love you forever
Can't forget you ever
Our love was meant to be
Please don't stop loving me
