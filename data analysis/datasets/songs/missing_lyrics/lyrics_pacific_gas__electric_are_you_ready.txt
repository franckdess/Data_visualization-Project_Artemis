There's rumors of war
Men dying and women crying
If you breathe air, you'll die
Perhaps you wonder the reason why
But wait! Don't you worry
A new day is dawning
We'll catch the sun, and away we'll fly...
Are you ready to sit by His throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then He'll carry you home
(Are you ready?) (2X)
People say that He won't come
And I don't know what say you
But if He should, would you be the one?
I've got a little question I'd like to ask you
Are you ready to sit by His throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then He'll carry you home
(Are you ready?) (2X)
Brothers and sisters, I have many
Stumbling along to do their thing
Love is a song, it's better than any
It's better for music, it's easy to sing
Are you ready to sit by His throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then He'll carry you home
Are you ready to sit by His throne?
Are you ready not to be alone?
Someone's coming to take you home
And if you're ready, then He'll carry you home
(Yes, I'm ready)
Are you ready? (Yes, I'm ready)
Are you ready? (Yes, I'm ready)
I've got to know, yeah (Yes, I'm ready)
You sound real good (Yes, I'm ready)
Are you ready? (Yes, I'm ready)
Gonna be sunshine again (Yes, I'm ready)
And the flowers growing (Yes, I'm ready)
Children playing (Yes, I'm ready)
Gonna be all right (Yes, I'm ready)
You've got to be ready (Yes, I'm ready)
I know you're ready (Yes, I'm ready)
Say it loud one more time (Yes, yes, I'm ready)
Oh, yeah (Yes, yes, I'm ready)
