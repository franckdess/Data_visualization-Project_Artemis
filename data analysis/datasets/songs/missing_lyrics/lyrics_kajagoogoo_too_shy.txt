Tongue tied or short of breath
Don't even try
Try a little harder
Something's wrong
You're not naive, you must be strong
Ooh, baby try

Hey girl, move a little closer

You're too shy shy, hush hush eye to eye
Too, shy shy, hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush hush eye to eye
Too, shy shy, hush hush

Modern medicine falls short of your complaint
Ooh, try a little harder
Moving in circles won't you dilate
Ooh, baby try

Hey girl, move a little closer

Cause you're too shy shy, hush hush eye to eye
Too, shy shy, hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy hush hush eye to eye
Too, shy shy, hush hush


You're too shy shy, hush hush eye to eye
Too, shy shy, hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy, hush hush eye to eye
Too, shy shy, hush hush
