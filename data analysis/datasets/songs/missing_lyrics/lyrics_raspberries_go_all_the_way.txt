Mama yeah! Woo!
Mama!
Ma-ma-ma-ma, yeah!

I never knew, never knew how complete love could be
Till she kissed me and said:

"Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold 'me close don't ever let me go"

I couldn't say what I wanted to say
Till she whispered:
"I love you so"

"Please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please go all the way
Just hold me close, don't ever let me go"

Before her love I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place where my heart should have been
But now I've changed and it feels so strange
I come alive when she does all those things to me
And she says:
"Come on, come on, come on
I need you, I love you, I need you"

"Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right being with you, here, tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close don't ever let me go"

Oh no
Uuuh, uuh, uuhh
Oh no
No, no, no, nah, nah
Go all the way, baby
Woo-hoo-ooo!
