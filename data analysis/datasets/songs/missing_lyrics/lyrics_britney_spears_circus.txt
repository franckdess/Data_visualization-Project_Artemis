There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first, oh-oh
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like a ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot when I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me, and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus

Let's go
Let me see what you can do
(Circus, circus)
I'm running this (Like a circus)
(Circus, circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like a circus)

All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus
All the eyes on me
In the center of the ring, just like a circus
When I crack that whip
Everybody gonna trip, just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go
We can make a dance floor, just like a circus
