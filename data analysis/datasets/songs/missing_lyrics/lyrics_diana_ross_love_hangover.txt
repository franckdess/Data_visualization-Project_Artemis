If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it
Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you
I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
The sweetest hangover
Yeah, I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get over
Ooh, I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
Sweet loving
(Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet loving
(Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
Don't call a doctor
Don't call her mama
Don't call her preacher
No, I don't need it
I don't want it
Sweet love, I love you
Sweet love, need love
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
No, no
I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't need it
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
