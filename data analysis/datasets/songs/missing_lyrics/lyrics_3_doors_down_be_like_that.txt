He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
Then he lies awake and he wonders
"Why can’t that be me?"
'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He’s left a lot of things he’d rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
Now and dreams we run

She spends her days up in the north park
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream
Is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold onto
That’s all she needs
Yeah

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
I’m falling into the same dreams
We run away

If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I could be like that
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that
What would I do?
What would I do?

Falling in
I feel I'm falling in, to this again
