You make me laugh
Cause your eyes, they light the night
They look right though me. La la la la
You bashful boy
You're hiding something sweet
Please give it to me, yeah, to me
Wo oh oh
Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all rhyme
Ooh yeah, yeah
You are a genie
All I ask for is your smile
Each time I rub the lamp. La la la la
When I am with you
I have a giggling teen-age crush
Then I'm a sultry vamp
Wo oh talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all rhyme
Ooh yeah, yeah
Talk to me somemore
You don't have to go
You're the poetry man
You make things all rhyme
So once again
It's time to say, so long
And so recall the lull of life
You're going home now
Home's that place somewhere you go each day
To see your wife
Wo oh Talk to me some more
You know that you don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all rhyme
