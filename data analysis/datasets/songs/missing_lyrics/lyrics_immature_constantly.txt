Constantly
Constantly
Constantly
I think about you all the time
Constantly, you're on my mind

At night I try to close my eyes
But I, I can't get much sleep, you're always on my mind
You look so fine, often pretend
That you're my girl or at least my friend

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl, don't you know I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day, I start drifting away
And I think of you

Constantly
I've got you on my mind constantly, babe
Constantly
And not just all of the time, I think about you
Constantly
If you only knew I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind

I practice my words and I build up the nerve
But uh, words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye time after time
Is love in the air or is it all in my mind?

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl, don't you know I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day, I start drifting away
And I think of you

Constantly
You're always on my mind, I think about you
Constantly
And not just all the time, I think about you
Constantly
Oh, if you only knewm I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind

I think about you baby
You're always on my mind

Constantly (ooh yeah, constantly, baby)
Constantly (whoa, I think about you, I think about you)
Constantly (when I wake up in the morning, when I go to bed at night)
I think about you all the time (think about you)
Constantly you're on my mind (you're on my mind)
Constantly (yeah, yeah, yeah, constantly)
Constantly (I want you, baby, please come to me)
Constantly
I think about you all the time...
