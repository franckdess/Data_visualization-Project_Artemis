There've been times in my life
I've been wondering why
Still, somehow I believed we'd always survive
Now, I'm not so sure you're waiting to hear
One good reason to try
But what more can I say
What's left to provide

(You think that maybe it's over)
(Only if you want it to be)
Are you gonna wait for a sign, your miracle
Stand up and fight

(This is it)
Make no mistake where you are
(This is it)
Your back's to the corner
(This is it)
Don't be a fool anymore
(This is it)

The waiting is over, no room to run
No way to hide
No time for wonderin' why
It's here, the moment is now, about to decide
Let 'em believe
Leave 'em behind
But keep me near in your heart
Know whatever you do
I'm here by your side

(You say that maybe it's over)
(Not if you don't want it to be)
For once in your life
Here's your miracle
Stand up and fight

(This is it)
Make no mistake where you are
(This is it)
You're goin' no further
(This is it)
Until it's over and done

(No one can tell you what you know)
Whoa-oh-ho, whoa-aaah
(Who makes the choice of how it goes)
It's not up to me this time
(You know)
Comes a day in every life

(This is it)
Make no mistake where you are
(This is it)
You're goin' no further
(This is it)
Until it's over and done
(This is it)
One way or another
(This is it)
(No one can tell what the future holds)
(This is it)
Your back's to the corner
(This is it)
(You make the choice of how it goes)
(This is it)
The waiting is over
(This is it)
(No one can tell what the future holds)
(This is it)
You're goin' no further
(This is it)
