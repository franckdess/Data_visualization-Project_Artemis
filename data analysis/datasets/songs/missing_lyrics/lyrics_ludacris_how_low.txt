Haha, Luda!
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know

I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know

I be like knick, knack, patty, wack
Oh, where my kitty cat?
Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla)
And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, well, there's just one thang that I gotta know

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't, stop â€“ get it, get it
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me whatchu working with
I'll show you some of this bankroll
Yeah, you a superstar
There's just one thang I gotta know, so
