Is there nothing I can say? Nothing I can do?
Change your mind, I'm so in love with you
Too deep in, you can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you

Don't you know promises were never meant to keep?
Just like the night, dissolve off in sleep
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Yeah, the other night, crying
Crying, baby, yeah, yeah, I'm crying
Yeah, I'm like a child, baby
I'm like a child, baby
Like a child
Yes, I'm like a child, like a child, like a child, like a child (Woo)

You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet Pekingese
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

Yeah, I was dreaming last night, babe
Last night, I was dreaming
How you'd be mine, but I was crying
Like a child, yeah, I was crying
Crying like a child
You will be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
You could be mine, could be mine
Could be mine, all mine

I come to you, so silent in the night
So stealthy, so animal quiet
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Yeah, you should be mine, mine, oh

Yes, you could be mine
Tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armor
Coming to your emotional rescue

You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
I will be your knight in shining armor
Riding across the desert on a fine Arab charger
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
