Ooh, boy
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh yeah

You walked in on the sly
Scoping for love
In the crowd I caught your eye
You can't hide your stuff

(You came to catch)
You thought I'd be naive and tame
(You met your match)
But I beat you at your own game, oh

(Who's zooming who?
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zooming who?
Who's zooming who?
(Who's zooming who?
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
(Who's zooming who?
Yeah

(Who's zooming who?
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zooming who?
Who's zooming who?
(Who's zooming who?
The fish jumped off the hook, baby
(Who's zooming who?
Yeah, yeah

Guess you believed the world
Played by your rules
Here stands an experienced girl
I ain't nobody's fool, bump you

(Don't speculate
You thought you had me covered now, boy
(I've got your bait
But you're bound to be my lover, oh


You think you're smooth
And you can pick and choose when the time is right
But just look behind, you'll be surprised to find
I'm gonna make you mine tonight, oh yeah
