To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

Girl, make a list
Go out and find yourself a new bad thing
Girl, you need a trip
Cause he's not worth the misery and pain
Just remember
How he would tell you lies
And then pretend that everything is so sweet
Why should you sacrifice
If you're not satisfied
He's just a canine running 'round in heat

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad
Oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh

Girl, you must resist
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart
No, girl, I must insist
You've got to stop the fool
Before he starts
Just remember how
He was so untrue
With all the tacky things he did to you
No need to signify
Cause he's not worth your time
You need to find someone that's true to you

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad
(Baby, don't be sad, no)
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh

To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea
Cute
(Cute, cute, cute)
Hey, Deele
Sing
To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad
(Baby, don't be sad, no)
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had
Oh, oh, oh
Don't let him put you down
Girl, he's been messing around
You've been used
Abused
Baby, make your move
You've learned your lesson now
So turn this hurt around
You ain't no fool
Cause you've got to bust loose
Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
