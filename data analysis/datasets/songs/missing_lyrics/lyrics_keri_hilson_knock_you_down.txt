Uh, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say (Mmh)
"Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today" (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp shit flying high (Flying high)
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky)
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest (Oh)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Hey, oh, it comes around)
And it knocks you down (Hey, yeah)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down) (Hey)
Sometimes love comes around (Ooh, whoa, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down, knocks you down)

Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Comes around, whoa)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Get back up when it knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around) (When love comes around)
And it knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh, when it knows you down, knocks you down)

Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (Oh, no, when it knocks you down)
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah
