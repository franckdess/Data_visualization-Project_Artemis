I tried to reach you, I canâ€™t hide
How strong's the feeling when we dive
I crossed the ocean of my mind
My wounds are healing with the salt
All my senses intensified
Whenever you and I, we dive
I crossed the ocean of my mind
But in the end I drown
You push me down, down


All the shame
When you called my name
I felt pain
When you came
