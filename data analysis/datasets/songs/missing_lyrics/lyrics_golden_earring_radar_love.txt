I've been driving all night
My hands wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby calling
Says "I need you here"
And it's half past four and I'm shifting gear

When she's lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar Love

The radio's playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming on Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar Love

No more speed I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now gotta take care
Last car to pass here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming on Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
One more radar love is gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
Don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar Love

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
