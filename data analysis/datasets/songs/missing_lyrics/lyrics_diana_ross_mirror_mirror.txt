Mirror, mirror
On the wall
You said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall
Mirror, mirror
On the wall
You
You turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama
Chapter one
When I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two
You promised me love
And anything that I desired
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
You have nailed my heart
Upon the wall for your pleasures
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken
And now
My eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I
Remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
You never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
I talk to you each night
And I follow your advise
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love?
Let me go!
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Let me go
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Mirror, mirror
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me
Mirror
Tell me
Mirror
Tell me
Mirror
Tell me
