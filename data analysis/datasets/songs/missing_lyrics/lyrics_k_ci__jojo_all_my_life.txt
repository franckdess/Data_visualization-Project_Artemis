Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby

I will never find another lover sweeter than you
Sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you
Girl you are close to me, you're like my mother
Close to me, you're like my father
Close to me, you're like my sister
Close to me, you're like my brother
And you are the only one my everything
And for you this song I sing

And all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
I said you're all that I'm thinking of, baby

Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love
I cherish every hug
I really love you

And all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do, love me

You're all that I ever know
When you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow
You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever know
When you smile, our face glows
You picked me up when I was down
Said, you're all that I ever know
When you smile, our face glows
You picked me up when I was down
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

And all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
And all my life, I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life, I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
