(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
(I gotta shake you off)
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta (Shake, shake you off)
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta
(Shake you off)

By the time you get this message, it's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me 'cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me, baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well, at first I didn't know, but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl who loves you more than me

(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
(I gotta shake you off)
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta (Shake, shake you off)
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta
(Shake you off)

(I gotta) Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
(I'm gonna shake it off)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

I found out about a gang of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one by the pool
On the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'mma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Yeah, 'cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby, I'm gone, don't ya know?

(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games

Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give (I like that, y'all)
