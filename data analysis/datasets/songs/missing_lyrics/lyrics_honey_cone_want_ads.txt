Wanted, young man single and free
Experience in love preferred, but will accept a young trainee
Oh, I'm gonna put it in the want ads, I need a love that's true
Gonna put it in the want ads, my man and I are through

At home I find myself, lost and all alone
My man is playing the field, the thrill is gone
He stays out all night, says he's with the boys
But lipstick on his collar, perfume on it too
Tells me he's been lying, tell ya what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna put it in the want ads, this girl's in misery
Gonna put it in the want ads, somebody rescue me

I spend my nights alone, cryin' bitter tears
Although I cry aloud, nobody really hears
And when I need him most, he's never by my side
He's either playing cards, or drinking at the bar
He thinks that I'm a fool, I'm going to the evening news

Gonna put it in the want ads, I need somebody new
Gonna put it in the want ads, my man and I are through

Extra extra, read all about it
