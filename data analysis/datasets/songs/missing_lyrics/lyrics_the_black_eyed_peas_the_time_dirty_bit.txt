I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you-you
You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
Youyouyouyouyouyouyouyou
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Dirty bit!
Dirty bit!

I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's go
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
'Til we can't do it no mo'
People rockin' to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
Until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in hurrrr
The temperaturrrre
Has got these ladies
Gettin' freaky-urrrr

I got freaky freaky baby
I was chilling with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie
I came here to get crazy
I was born to get wild
That's my style
If you didn't know that
Well, baby, now you know now

'Cause I'm... havin'...
A good, time, with you
I'm tellin' you

I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you-you
You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
Youyouyouyouyouyouyouyou
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Dirty bit!
Dirty bit!

All-all these girls, they like my swagger
They callin' me Mick Jagger
I be Rolling like a Stone
Jetsetter, jetlagger
We ain't messin' with no maggots
Messin' with the baddest
Chicks in the club
Honey, what's up?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Yeah it's gotta be the apl
I'm the mack daddy, y'all
Haters better step back
Ladies (Download your Ap')
I'm the party application
Rockin' just like that

For every ending, is mega starter
When they bring the dark
We bring the light, let's go
