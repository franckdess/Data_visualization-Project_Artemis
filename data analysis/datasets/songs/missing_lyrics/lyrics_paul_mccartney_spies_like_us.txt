Ooh, ooh, what do you do?
No one else can dance like you
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

Hey, hey, what do you say?
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

Hey don't feel afraid of an undercover aid
There's no need to fuss
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Spies like us
We don't know the meaning of fear
We play every minute by ear
One for all and all for one
Everybody's on the run
Especially at this time of year

Ooh, ooh, what do you do?
No one else can dance like you
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

Hey, hey, what do you say?
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

We get there by hook or by crook
We don't do a thing by the book
Never needed special clothes
How we did it no one knows
I guess we must have had what it took

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh when things get tough (oh when things get tough)
Guys like us act rough (guys like us act rough)

Hey, hey, what do you say?
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Spies like us

Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
Spies like us
