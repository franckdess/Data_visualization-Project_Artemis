One, two
One, two, three, uh!

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

The kind you find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright

The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her
