Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die
