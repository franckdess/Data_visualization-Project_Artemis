I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And now we realize
Love's not all that it's supposed to be
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feeling stronger every day

I know we really tried
Together we had love inside
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feeling stronger every day

After what you've meant to me
Ooh baby now
I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that we both agree
Best thing to happen to you
The best thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We love you
We love you
Let's spend the night together
We love you
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

Feeling stronger every day
Feeling stronger every day
Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day

Feeling stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feeling stronger every day
