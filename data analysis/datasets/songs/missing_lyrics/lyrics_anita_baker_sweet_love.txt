With all my heart, I love you, baby
Stay with me, and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave, cause I believe

I'm in love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name - I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

Your heart has called me closer to you
I will be all that you need
Just trust in what we're feeling
Never leave 'cause, baby, I believe

In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name - I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love;
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way

There's no stronger love in this world
Oh, baby, no - you're my man, I'm your girl
I'll never go - Wait and see, can't be wrong
Don't you know this is where you belong?

Oh, the sweetest dream, a lovely baby
Stay right here, never fear
I will be all that you need
Never leave 'cause, baby, I believe

In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name - I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
