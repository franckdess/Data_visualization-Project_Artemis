Boy there you go
You're tellin me that you love me
When will you know
That you belong to another girl who loves you

You are so fine
You blow my mind
With the things you do to me
She sees she's not blind
To the things you do for me
But I know

I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Friends ask how could
I give myself to one who belongs to someone else
They just don't know
Your love's so good
That they would want for themselves

You are so fine
You blow my mind
With the things you for to me
She sees she's not blind
To the things you do for me
But I know

I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do

You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not
Ooh, what am I supposed to do

I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
