:
This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you anymore
Because of my obligations and the ties that you have
We've been meeting here everyday
And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this
Let's just kiss and say goodbye}
:
I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me 'till I'm through
This is somethin' I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darlin', don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy
Understand me, oh won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try?
Let's just kiss an' say goodbye
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
Understand me, oh won't you try?
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Take my handkerchief an' wipe your eyes
Maybe you'll find, you'll find another guy
Well let's kiss and say goodbye, pretty baby
Please, don't you cry
Understand me, oh won't you try?
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
