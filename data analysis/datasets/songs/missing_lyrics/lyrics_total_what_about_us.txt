Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, come on
I like the way it's goin' down
I ain't done a remix in a long time
I like to make it hot
I like to make it real hot
Black Rob, come on

Aye yo, who dat, comin' through my block like that
Oh, nobody but that Bad Boy cat
What's his name?, Black Rob
Ya'll heard duke was famous
Money-soft, Puffy joints, Total house the ladies
It's bangin' in the clubs, oh my good
Ya'll be wishin' that those brothers came through my hood
Take a diffrent approach, just play respect the coach
That's Black, since I'm rollin' wit' Total
That's that

Baby, seen you lookin' at other ladies
Just finished having your baby
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me
Baby, you know I'm about to be swazy
Can't stop my lover from being shady
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me

What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
What you gon' do?
Total help me sing
What about you?
What about me?
What about us?
What you gon' do?
What we gonna do
What we gonna do (yeah)

Baby, I know that you've been pimpin'
Mr. Baller, trickin'
Why'd you have to go, go and leave me
Baby, I always been your baby
Love makin' this girl go crazy
I can't understand, why you left me... uh-hmm


I remember we used to spend
Countless nights, you were my best of friends
Our love, could be one that never ends
Whatever happened to yours

Aye yo, what about you, what about me
I'm tryin' to get dough, nothin' come for free
And I know you like the way, Black flava parlay
I slide like a man, with gators on Parcae
Floors, it's me who hordes the door like Prince
Navigator Doo Doo Brown, the quint wit' light tint
Me and Mruder, gotta be the cheddar we seein' first
Oh I ain't gonna spit one verse (one verse)
Sometimes I feel cursed, ya'll dson't want me to rise
Dough in the purse
Rather see me faze down, in the back of a hursh
But I reufse to lose, don't batter the bruised
Throw mine's, to get my grill on the 6 o'clock news
We be smoke, pretty E wit' D in E-class
Spittin' flase information, I know gone need back-up
Till you can't, Black Rob heavyweight champ
When I strike, I'm gonna leave Bad Boy stamp, come on (what about us!)
