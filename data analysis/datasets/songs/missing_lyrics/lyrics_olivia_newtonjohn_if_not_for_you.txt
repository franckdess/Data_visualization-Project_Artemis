If not for you
Babe, I couldn't even find the door
I couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue
If not for you

If not for you
Babe, the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
It would not be new
If not for you

If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love
I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost
If not for you

If not for you
The Winter would hold no Spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
If not for you

If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love
I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost
If not for you

If not for you
The Winter would hold no Spring
You couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
If not for you

If not for you
