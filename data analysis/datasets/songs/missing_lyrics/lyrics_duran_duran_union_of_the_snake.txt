Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing
My senses together
And I think it's about to break
If I listen close I can hear them singers
Voices in your body coming through on the radio
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline
Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength at least give me a light
Give me anything even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right
If I listen close I can hear them singers
Voices in your body coming through on the radio
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline
If I listen close I can hear them singers
Voices in your body coming through on the radio
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Gonna move up to the borderline
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline
