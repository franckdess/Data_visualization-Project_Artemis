There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A-telling me, I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Are gettin’ so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

What a field day for the heat (Ooo-ooo-ooo)
A thousand people in the street (Ooo-ooo-ooo)
Singing songs and a-carryin’ signs (Ooo-ooo-ooo)
Mostly say, "Hooray for our side" (Ooo-ooo-ooo)

It's time we stopped
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going
We better stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
