It's twelve past midnight
Don't close your eyes
Your soul's half alive
And I'll be by your side
I've come to take you there
Show you how to care
Just be aware
That you'll have to share

I want your love
I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart
So don't you fight
I'll be your answer
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
Your favorite dish

From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love

You saw a brand new high
Thought that you could fly
Did I hear you cry
Or did you like the ride?
You call my name again
No, it's not a sin
I'll show you how to win
And where I've been

I want your love
I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart
So don't you fight
I'll be your answer
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
Your favorite dish

From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love

You'll never have to run away
You'll always have a friend to play
You'll never go out on your own
In me
You will find a home
Home

From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
