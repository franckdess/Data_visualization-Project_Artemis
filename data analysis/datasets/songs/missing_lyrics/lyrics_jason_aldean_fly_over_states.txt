Couple guys in first class on a flight from New York to Los Angeles 
Kinda making small talk, killin' time, flirtin' with the flight attendants 
Thirty thousand feet above what would be Oklahoma 

Just a bunch of square corn fields and wheat farms, man it all looks the same 
Miles and miles of back roads and highways connecting little towns with funny names 
Who'd wanna live down there, in the middle of nowhere 

They've never drove through Indiana 
Met the man who plowed that Earth 
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me 
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas 
They'd understand why God made those fly over states 

I bet that mile haul in Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all 
Just like that flat bed cowboy stacking U.S. steel on a three day haul 
Roads and rails under their feet, yeah that sounds like a first class seat 

On the plains of Oklahoma 
With a windshield sunset in your eyes 

Like a watercolor painted sky 
You'll think heaven's doors have opened 
You'll understand why God made those fly over states 

Take a ride across the Badlands 
Feel that freedom on your face 
Breathe in all that open space 
And meet a girl from Amarillo

You'll understand why God made... 
You might even wanna plant your stakes 
In those fly over states 
Yeah 

Have you ever been through Indiana 
On the plains of Oklahoma 
Take a ride
