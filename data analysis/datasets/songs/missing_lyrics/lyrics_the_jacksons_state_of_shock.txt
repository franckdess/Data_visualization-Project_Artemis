Yeah, come on, baby

You gotta be mine
'cause you're so fine
I like your style
It makes me wild
You take it to me good
You like it, know you should
You get me on my knees
Well, please, baby, please

Listen
She looks so great, every time I see her face
She put me in a state, a state of shock

Oh, do it
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby

She put me on my knees
Please, baby, please
I know you like to tease
Please, baby, please
You take it to me good
You like it, know you should
I love the way you walk
And talk, baby, talk

Listen
She looks so great, every time I see her face
She put me in a state, a state of shock

She put me, state of shock
Come on, dear, no, come over here
Talk, talk to me, state of shock
State of shock

State of shock
You know I really want you mama
You got me paralyzed
You got me paralyzed
You got me catatonic
You got me catatonic, baby
State of shock

You got me supersonic, baby
Baby, try, you know I'm deep fried
State of shock

Look what you done to me
Look what you done to me

Come on, baby
You know I've really loved you, baby
State of shock
