Yeah

I’m not that kind of guy who can take a broken heart
So don’t ever leave
I don’t want to see us part
The very thought of losing you means
That everything
Would go down under

I’ll be loving you forever
(Just as long as you want me to be)
I’ll be loving you forever
(All this love’s for you and me) Yeah
(I’ll be loving you) I’ll be
(I’ll be loving you) Loving you
(The things you do) Yeah, it’s forever
(I’ll be loving you) I’ll be
(I’ll be loving you) Loving you
Yeah

I count the blessings that keep our love new
There’s one for me
And a million for you
There’s just so much that I wanna say
But when I look at you
All my thoughts get in the way

I’ll be loving you forever
(Just as long as you want me to be)
I’ll be loving you forever
(All this love’s for you and me) Yeah
(I’ll be loving you) I’ll be
(I’ll be loving you) Loving you
(The things you do) Yeah, it’s forever
(I’ll be loving you) I’ll be
(I’ll be loving you) Loving you
Yeah

We’ve come too far to ever turn back now
This love will last forever
I can see it all now

(I’ll be loving you) I’ll be
(I’ll be loving you) Loving you
(The things you do) Yeah, is forever
(I’ll be loving you) I’ll be
(I’ll be loving you) Loving only you, girl

Oh girl
I’ll be loving only you
(I’ll be loving you)
(I’ll be loving you)
Be loving you girl
(I’ll be loving you)
