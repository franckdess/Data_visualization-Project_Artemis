Its now or never; Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
Its now or never; My love won't wait
When I first saw you with your smile so tender
My heart was captured; My soul surrendered
I've spent a life time waiting for the right time
Now that you're near the time is here at last
It's now or never; Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never; My love won't wait
Just like a willow we could cry an ocean
If we lost true love and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me; Let your arms invite me
For who knows when we'll meet again this way
It's now or never; Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling; be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never; My love won't wait
