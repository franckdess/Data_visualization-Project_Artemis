If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make-up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

You got your high brow, switchin' your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make-up nobody knows who you even are

Now don't you dare act like you don't know (don't know)
Know what's up (Know what's up) cause your nose is up
When I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior(Dior)
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup

Cause it sure seems you got no doubts
But we all see you got your head in the clouds
