Memories are just where you leave them
Drag the waters, 'til the depths give up their dead
What did you expect to find?
Was it something you left behind?
Don't you remember anything I said when I said

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

"Oh, hold me now, I feel contagious"
"Am I the only place that you've left to go?"
She cries her life is like
Some movie, black and white
Dead actors faking lines
Over and over and over again she cries

Don't fall away and leave me to myself
Don't fall away and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands
Love lies bleeding

And I wanted you to turn away
You don't remember, but I do
You never even tried

Don't fall away, and leave me to myself
Don't fall away, and leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Leave love bleeding
In my hands, in my hands again
Woah Oooh Oh
