Shoo (Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo, ah)
Shoo (Shoo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Shoo (Oh, oh, oh)
Shoo (Hey)

Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from, yeah
But you will see, it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine

Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seems so uptight
But nothin's wrong and it's alright with my man (My man)
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on, with my man
People out there can understand

I'm giving him something he can feel
(Ooh) To let him know this love is real (hey, oh, I'm...)
Giving him something he can feel (All my lovin')
To let him know this love is real (Oh my love is real)
This love is real

So much joy for us, it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
(Hey, hey, oh yeah)
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true
You tell me what does it mean
(Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)

Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight, hey
Nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man (My man)
I like the way we carry on
His lovin' will send me on and on, with my man
People out there can understand that

I'm giving him something he can feel
To let him know this love is real
(That I'm giving love, giving giving love, yeah)
Giving him something he can feel
(Nah nah, nah nah, yeah yeah, talk to me)
To let him know this love is real
(I gotta let him know that this love's strong, yeah)
This love is real
Giving him something he can feel
(Giving, I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving love)
Giving him something he can feel
(Giving, I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving love)
Giving him something he can feel
(Ooh, so sweet to me, so sweet to me, baby, yeah)
Giving him something he can feel...
