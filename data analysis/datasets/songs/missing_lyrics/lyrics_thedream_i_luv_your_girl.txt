And you know what I mean ahh, baam baam

Trick beat the track up like gorillas (Ahh)
I, I, I, I (Yeah)

We up in the club (Club), I see her do her thang (Thang)
You might wanna rap, but she'll make you sing (Sing)
See I was on her, but she was on him
She all up on ma thang, I got my thang on her hip
She ATL pop, don't know how to act
She left for one song, and came right back
Grindin on me, the rest of the night
Her man started muggin', he could see it in my eyes

Lil' mama so hood (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high (I love your girl)
Man look at shawty roll (I love your girl)
Man, look at shawty go (I love your girl)
I'm sorry I got it in for your girl, girlfriend

Now she run her
Fingers through her hair, he tryna call her over there, but she like
(Fuck! That nigga!) She drop it
Down to the floor, I'm like shorty you should go, but she like
(Fuck! That nigga!)
Call it envy, I want her on me
All up in my head, now she in my bed, I
I, I, I, I

Me and lil' shawty in the back
Talkin' bout this, talkin' bout that
Got her on the 'Tron, she actin' all bad
Your girl chose me, don't be mad
Kelly told y'all don't bring 'em in the club
The way she rock that, got the boy in love
And I pray that y'all ain't serious
Cause seriously she's on my dick

Lil' mama so hood (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go (I love your girl)
I'm sorry I got it in for your girl, girlfriend

Now she run her
Fingers through her hair, he tryna call her over there, but she like
(Fuck! That nigga!) She drop it
Down to the floor, I'm like shorty you should go, but she like
(Fuck! That nigga!)
Call it envy, I want her on me
All up in my head, now she in my bed, I
I, I, I, I

Ayy, oh I (Ayy)
Oh I

Usually, you won't
See me hate on another dude
My heart got me up in here willing to
Separate you from ya boo
But she on me, and I'm on her
We walking out the club, shawty what's up
Mmm I want her in the worst way, plus I
Just found out that it's her birthday

Lil' mama so hood (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go (I love your girl)
I'm sorry I got it in for your girl, girlfriend

Now she run her
Fingers through her hair, he tryna call her over there, but she like
