Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Money, sex in full control, a generation without soul
Perfect people in a perfect world
Behind closed doors all in control
Life, in a world of luxury
Cold cash money mentality
You gotta keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith
You'd better keep the faith and run away
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
It's time to break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh
You better break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh
Money, sex in full control, look, big brother is watching you
Unlock your brain and save your soul
No more limits, no more curfew
Life in the perfect system
Take a stand and fight for freedom
Keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith
You'd better keep the faith and run away
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
It's time to break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh
You better break free, oh oh oh oh, run away, oh oh oh oh
Keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith
You'd better keep the faith and run away
Keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith
You'd better keep the faith and run away
