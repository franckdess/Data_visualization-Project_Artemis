Yeah, Spyderman and Freeze in full effect
Uh-huh
You ready, Ron?
I'm ready
You ready, Biv?
I'm ready, Slick, are you?
Oh, yeah, break it down

Girl, I, must (warn you)
I sense something strange in my mind

Situation is (serious)
Let's cure it cause we're running out of time

It's oh, so (beautiful)
Relationships they seem from the start
It's all so (deadly)
When love is not together from the heart

It's drivin' me out of my mind!
That's why it's HARD for me to find
Can't get it out of my head!
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move you're dead!)

That girl is (poison)...
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (poison)..
("POISON!!")


(-caution)
Before I start to meet a fly girl, you know?

Cause in some (portions)
You'll think she's the best thing in the world

She's so - (fly)
She'll drive you right out of your mind
And steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
YOU'LL fall in love and you'll be screamin', demon, HOO..

Poison, deadly, movin' in slow
Lookin for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Gettin paid, laid, so better lay low
Schemin on house, money, and the whole show
The low pro ho she'll be cut like an aaa-FRO
See what you're sayin', huh, she's a winner to you
But I know she's a loser (How do you know?)
Me and the crew used to do her!

"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!"
"POISON!

I was at the park, shake, breakin and takin 'em all
And that night, I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas, the highs and lows
Keepin' one eye open, still clockin' the hoes
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be, the high power chest
Michael Biv here and I'm runnin' the show
Bell, Biv DeVoe 
..now you know!
Yo, Slick, blow..

It's drivin' me out of my mind!
That's why it's HARD for me to find
Can't get it out of my head!
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move you're dead!)

That girl is (poison)...
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (poison)..
("POISON!!")

Yo' fellas, that was my end of..
You know what I'm sayin', Mike?
Yeah, B.B.D. in full effect
Yo', wassup to Ralph T and Johnny G
And I can't forget about my boy, B. Brown
And the whole NE crew
Poison..
