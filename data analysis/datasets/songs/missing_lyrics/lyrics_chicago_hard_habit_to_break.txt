I guess I thought you'd be here
Forever
Another illusion
I chose to create
You don't know what you got
Until it's gone
And I found out
A little too late
I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone
And it was all wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe
You're a hard habit to break
You found somebody else
You had every reason
You know I can't blame you
For running to him
Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading my love
Too thin
After all of these years
I'm still trying to shake it
Doing much better
They say that it just takes time
But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe
You're a hard habit to break
I can't go on (can't go on)
Just can't go on (just can't go on)
I can't go on (can't go on)
Just can't go on (just can't go on)

Being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you
You're a hard (you're a) habit to (hard) break (habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
Such a hard (such a) habit to (hard) break (habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
I'm addicted to you
You're a hard (you're a) habit to (hard) break (habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
Such a hard (such a) habit to (hard) break (habit to break)
(Just can't go on)
I'm addicted to you baby!
