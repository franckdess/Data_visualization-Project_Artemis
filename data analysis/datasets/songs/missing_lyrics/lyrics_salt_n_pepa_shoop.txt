(Hey yeah, I wanna shoop baby!)
Ooh, how you doing baby?
No, not you, you, the bow-legged one, yeah
Whatâ€™s your name?
Damn baby, that sounds sexy

Uh, here I go, here I go, here I go again
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!)
Ok then, chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda uh
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits
A ho, no that don't make me
See what I want slip slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop

Um, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake booty
If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang?
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha-
Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth black skin with a smile
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum
Chocolate chip, honey dip, can I get a scoop?
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna

Shoop shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop

Well let me bring you back to the subject, Pep's on the set
Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat
When you skip-to-my-lou, my darling
Not falling in love but I'm falling for your (Super sperm)
When I get ya betcha bottom dollar you were best under pressure
Getcha getcha lips wet cause it's time to have Pep

On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop
To the next man in the three-piece suit
I spend all my dough, ray me, cutie
Shoop shoop a-doobie like Scoobie Doobie Doo
I love you in your big jeans, you give me nice dreams
You make me wanna scream, ooo, oooo, oooo
I like what you do when you do what you do
You make me wanna shoop

And he's comin' this way, oooh

But I'm wicked, G, (yeah) hit skins but never quickly (that's right)
I hit the skins for the hell of it, just for the yell I get
Mmm mmm mmm, for the smell of it
They want my bod, here's the hot rod (hot rod)
Twelve inches to a yard and have you sounding like a retard (yeah)
