You should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time, I looked at his hand
I was talking to an Eskimo
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow
When up popped a sea lion ready to go

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Take me down!

At the Houses of Parliament
Everybody's talking about the President
We all chip in for a bag of cement
Ollie Hardy should have had more sense
He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence
All for the sake for a couple of pence

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Everybody tag along
Ha!  Huh, ha!

I took my bag to the grocer's store
The price is higher than the time before
Old man asked why is it more
I said you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time, I looked at his hand

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low
(Down to Junior's Farm.)
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm.  (Down to Junior's Farm.)
Let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low
(Down to Junior's Farm.)
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm.  (Down to Junior's Farm.)
Everybody tag along.  (Everybody tag along.)
Take me down to Junior's Farm right now
Ow!
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Take me back
Take me back
I wanna go back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eh
(Gasping)
