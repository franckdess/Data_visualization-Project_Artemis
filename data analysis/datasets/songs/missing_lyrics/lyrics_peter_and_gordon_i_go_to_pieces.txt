When I see her comin' down the street
I get so shaky and I feel so weak
I tell my eyes look the other way
But they don't seem to hear a word I say

And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

I tell my arms they'll hold someone new
Another love that will be true
But they don't listen, they don't seem to care
They reach for her but she's not there

And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

I remember what she said when she said
"Goodbye, baby. We'll meet again soon maybe
But until we do, all my best to you"
I'm so lonely, I think about her only

I go to places we used to go
But I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside
Now I hope she's satisfied

And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

Go to pieces and I cry
Every time my baby passes by
Go to pieces and I cry
Every time my baby passes by
