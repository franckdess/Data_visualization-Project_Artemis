It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fools game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down
It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fools game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
Oh, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down
It's a fools game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It's a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down
It's a fools game
Standing in the cold rain ...
