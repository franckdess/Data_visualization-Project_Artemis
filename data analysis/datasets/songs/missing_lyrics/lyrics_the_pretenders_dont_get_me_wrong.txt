I look in your eyes, see paradise
But am I dreaming
And I touch, feel your embrace
Smile on your face sends my mind reeling
Round and round
I can't believe, I lose control
Open my heart, open my soul
I can't believe, don't make me fall
Don't leave me alone, tear down the wall
That's been around me
All my life
Every day you're my tender offender
I do surrender to your will
Every night you're my tender offender
Always remember, the special thrill
In my heart you instil
I just can't hide these feelings inside
I've got to show you
And I know, I come on too strong
Don't get me wrong I'll never hurt you
I never will
I've been around you all my life
Every day you're my tender offender
I do surrender to your will
Every night you're my tender offender
Always remember, the special thrill
In my heart you instil
Every day I'm your tender offender
Will you surrender to my will
Every night I'm your tender offender
I'm no pretender 'cause the thrill
In your heart I'll instil
