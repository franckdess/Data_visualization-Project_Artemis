You send cold chills
Up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills
Then you draw the line
Oh baby (Oh baby)
'Cause your mama told you
That love ain't right
But don't you know
Good lovin' is the spice of life, yeah

Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'
Ooh, ooh, now baby
Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me wishing

(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
You want my lovin' yes you do, do, do
You know my lovin' is true, true, true
Now baby
But your conscience tells you
That love is wrong
But just a little lovin' never hurt no one, oh

Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'
Ooh, ooh, now baby
Goody girl, let down those curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Don't keep me wishing

Let all it hang (Girl, don't be afraid)
(Oh, we've got the first step made)
(Ooh, the rest is up to you)
(Here is what to do)
(Let yourself go)
Let yourself just oh now, now no
Let your lovin' go now, now
Just give it to me
('Cause I got what you need)
I got what you need
Let's fall in love, let's fall in love

Find out what you're missin'
Goody girl lay down your curls
Let me give your heart a twirl
Why don't you give my love a whirl (Girl, don't be afraid)
(Oh, we've got the first step made)
(Ooh, just give it, just give it to me)
('Cause I got what you need)
Got what you need
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
(Let's yourself go)
Let yourself just oh now, now no
Let your lovin' go now, now
Just give it to me
('Cause I got what you need)
Oh, mama's pearl
(Girl, don't be afraid)
(Let's fall in love, let's fall in love)
(Daddy's girl we've got it made)
I know what you been missin', sugar!
Goody, goody, goody girl, ooh
