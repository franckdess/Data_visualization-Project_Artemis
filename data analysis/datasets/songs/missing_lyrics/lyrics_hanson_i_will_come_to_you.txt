I'm the dude that's running it like a 5k
Kid  with the knack for killing it
Looking  Pompeii
Spit flames
Making fire blaze
Making  big waves
Do  it all day
In a big way
Replay 
I'm the dude that's running it like a 5k
Vonte just a little bit picante
When I hop out the car
They  lose all regard
For the neighborhood
Now you can say I'm good
Make your decision
If you ain't got shit to say
Shut up and listen
I'm cool in the kitchen
Autocorrect him to cook
Bastard
Can't catch me
Like you're chip Hanson
Murder the beat
Like I'm chip masion
Looking in the mirror like
(Damn he's handsome)
You can still catch these hands
Like you're Danny phantom
Catch these hands like you're Danny phantom
Who's next
Hands and I will be counting my checks
New shirt that I bet will rip if I flex
I'm wasting my money
Ice on my neck
I don't need a chain I'm a big dog
I don't need bark
When I get it done yeah I do do do do do do do
Baby shark
I'm too clean you can't mess with me
When they burn trees we burn effigies
And I'm the Referee
Yeah I call the shots
Human Millipede
I got a thousand socks
When they step to me they look up
And I'm looking down on them
I'm six foot four
It's hard for me to find pants when I want them
Winter solstice that's a long night
Take a trip to France
Now that's a long flight
I'm electric with it
You can ask Ben Franklin
Got the key
And I'mma fly along kite
I not the man when I come through
But imma throw a party that they'll come to
If you go and ask my dudes what I'm gone do
They say I'm bout to set it off and be dumb cool
You best not mess with my mans
Or I'll put in work with my hands
Pulling up ( SKIIIIIIRRRT ) in that 2007
Best understand
You cannot switch up the plan
Try to make a banger like I'm knocking on a door
Only got the juice if I'm going to the store
It's got to get hot
Right after them shots
No water in the club
We got em sitting on the floor
Phone don't ring
No I can't talk
Yeah I run the game
No I can't walk
Aye I got a woman
Back your ass up
Just back your ass up
Not back youor ass up
I've been out here working
I've been working Just to stack up
I don't need no condiments
I don't need no kachup
You're playing catch up
I've been at it for a minute
I ain't even playing
Only reason I'm not winnin
You can see it in my walk
Clumsy in the kitchen
I'll be dripping with the sauce
And I look good in what I wear they'll be asking what it cost
All except for my underwear I got most of it at Ross
Young and staying under covers
Like I'm Cody banks
Say they got some shooters
That ain't doing shit but shooting blanks
Looking at ya boy
Thinking that he robbed a bank
Tell me lighten up the tred
I'mma have to cop a tank
Yeah they're looking at you
Cuz you got the newest Tech
Yeah you're looking Frozen
Got some ice up on your Neck
And you got it just to flex
Now that's a Flex
I can't Respect
Cuz you know you're gunna to sacrifice
The art to get the Check
Head in the clouds
The only
One
Couldn't fall asleep
They told me
Run
