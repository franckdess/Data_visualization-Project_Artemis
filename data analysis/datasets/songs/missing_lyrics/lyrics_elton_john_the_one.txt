I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

All I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one
