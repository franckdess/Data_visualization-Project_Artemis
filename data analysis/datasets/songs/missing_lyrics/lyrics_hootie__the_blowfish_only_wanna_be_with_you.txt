You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby cause the Dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you
You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you
(Solo)
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you
Sometimes I wonder
If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby yeah
The Dolphins make me cry
Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
