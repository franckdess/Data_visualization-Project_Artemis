I dig Rock and Roll music
And I love to get the chance to play. (and sing it)
I figure it's about the happiest sound goin' down today
The message may not move me
Or mean a great deal to me
But hey! it feels so groovy to say:
I dig the Mamas and the Papas at "The Trip,"
Sunset Strip in L.A
And they got a good thing goin'
When the words don't get in the way
And when they're really wailing
Michelle and Cass are sailin'
Hey! they really nail me to the wall
I dig Donovan in a dream-like, tripped out way
His crystal images tell you 'bout a brighter day
And when the Beatles tell you (Beatles tell you)
They've got a word "love" to sell you
They mean exactly what they say
I dig Rock and Roll music
I could really get it on in that scene
I think I could say somethin' if you know what I mean
But if I really say it, the radio won't play it
Unless I lay it between the lines
