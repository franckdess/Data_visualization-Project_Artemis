Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
And I feel like a-loving you
Love, you're such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat thing
And that's just a-what I'm gonna do
Oh love, to hold ya
Oh love, to kiss ya
Oh love, I love it so
Oh love, you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar
Oh love, I won't let you go

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
And as silly as it may seem
The loving that you're giving
Is what keeps me living
And your love is like
Peaches and cream
Kind-a like sugar
Kind-a like spices
Kind-a like, like what you do
Kind-a sounds funny
But love, honey
And honey, I love you

Para, pararara
Para, pararara

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
That your love can satisfy
Love, you're such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat thing
And sweet thing, that ain't no lie
I love to hold ya
I love, to kiss ya
Oh love, I love it so
Oh love, you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar
Oh love, I won't let you go
