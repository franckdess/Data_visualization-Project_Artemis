No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Memories, good days, bad days (Memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (They'll be with me always)
In these old familiar rooms, children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do


Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do
