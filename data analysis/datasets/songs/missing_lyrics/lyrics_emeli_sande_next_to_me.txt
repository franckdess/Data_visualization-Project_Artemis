You won't find him drinking under tables,
Rolling dice, or staying out till three
You won't ever find him being unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

You won't find him trying chase the devil
For money, fame for power, out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me

When the skies are gray and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we've spoiled the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
Next to me, ooh hoo
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
