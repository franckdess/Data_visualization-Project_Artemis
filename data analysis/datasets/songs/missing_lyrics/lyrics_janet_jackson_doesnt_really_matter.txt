Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter at all

Doesn't matter what your friends are telling you
Doesn't matter what my family's saying too
It just matters that I'm in love with you
It only matters that you love me too
It doesn't matter if they won't accept you
I'm accepting of you and the things you do
Just as long as it's you
Nobody but you, baby, baby

My love for you, unconditional love too
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that it...

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me

You're so kind
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
And you're mine
And I can't believe you're mine

Doesn't matter if you're feeling insecure
Doesn't matter if you're feeling so unsure
'Cause I'll take away the doubt within' your heart
And show that my love will never hurt or harm
Doesn't matter what the pain we go through
Doesn't matter if the money's gone too
Just as long as I'm with you
Nobody but you, baby, baby

Your love for me, unconditional I see
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that it

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me

You're so kind
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
And you're mine
And I can't believe you're mine

Doesn't matter what they say
'Cause you know I'm gonna love you anyway
Doesn't matter what they do
'Cause my love will always be with you

My love for you, unconditional love too
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that my love is true, and it's just for you

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
'Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me

And best of all is you're nutty, nutty, nutty for me

Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you

I've finally found somebody whose heart is true
And best of all is you love me too
And nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you
I can't believe my dreams come true
I'm always doing that!
I've finally found somebody whose heart is true
And best of all is you're nutty, nutty, nutty for me
