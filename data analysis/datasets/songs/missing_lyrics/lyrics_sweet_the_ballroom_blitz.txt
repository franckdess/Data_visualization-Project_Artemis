Almost saw her heart beat
Under the necklaces
Caked-on concealer
Sorry 'bout the zit
She's a fan of 5SOS
But only cause they're so hot
Sippin' drinks at Starbucks
Didn't know what else to say

Except "hey, little girl, would you rock my world?"
Cause I love who you are, you look like a lucky star
With that makeup on, just like a young Madonna
Hey, I'm in love again
Do you remember prom night?

Your brother loves his country
Dad loves ballroom blitz
Mommy closed your Instagram
It was inappropriate
Maybe I'll go with you
Driving up Mulholland
On a teenage quest for a future husband

I said "hey, little girl, would you rock my world?"
Cause I love who you are, you look like a lucky star
With that makeup on, just like a young Madonna
Hey, I'm in love again
Do you remember prom night?

Gun me around in your sweet Chevelle
We don't need any safety belts
Blast the Scorpions, yeah
We're that cool
They're gonna play the Forum soon
Do you want to go?
But somehow we got separated
And I went back home all alone

I said "hey, little girl, would you rock my world?"
Cause I love who you are, you look like a lucky star
With that makeup on, just like a young Madonna
Hey, I'm in love again
Do you remember prom night?
Remember prom night?
Remember prom night
Oo-oo-hoo-hoo
