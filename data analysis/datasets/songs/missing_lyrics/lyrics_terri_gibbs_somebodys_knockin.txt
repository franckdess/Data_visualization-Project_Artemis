Somebody's knockin'
Should I let him in
Lord, it's the devil
Would you look at him
I've heard about him
But I never dreamed
He'd have blue eyes and blue jeans
Well somebody's talkin'
He's whispering to me
Your place or my place
Well, which will it be
I'm gettin' weaker
And he's comin' on strong
But I don't wanna go wrong
He must have tapped my telephone line
He must have known
I'm spendin' my time
Alone
He says we'll have one heavenly night
My fever's burnin'
So he ought be right at home
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let him in
Lord, it's the devil
Would you look at him
I've heard about him
But I never dreamed
He'd have blue eyes and blue jeans
He must have tapped my telephone line
He must have known
I'm spendin' my time
Alone
He says we'll have one heavenly night
My fever's burnin'
So he ought be right at home
Somebody's knockin'
(Somebody's knockin')
Oh, somebody's knockin'
