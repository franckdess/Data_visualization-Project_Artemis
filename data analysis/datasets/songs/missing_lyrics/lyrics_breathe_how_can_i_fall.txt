Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart
Is not always there
What more can I say to you?
Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know
I should make a move
What more can I say?

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't
Give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yet, I know of the harm I do
What more can I say to you?
Now I hold this line
I know the choice to leave is mine
I can't help
What I feel inside
What more can I say?


I'll follow through
I'll see I do
When the time is far more
Right for you
I'll make that move
And when I do
Will I doubt again the way I do?

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons
Just won't give me reasons
Just won't give me reasons at all
How can I fall?
I fall, I fall
How can I fall for you?
How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons
