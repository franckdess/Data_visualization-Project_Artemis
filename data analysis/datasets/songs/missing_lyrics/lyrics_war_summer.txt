Ridin' round town with all the windows down
Eight track playin' all your favorite sounds
The rhythm of the bongos fill the park
The street musicians tryin' to get a start
Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes it's summer
My time of year
Yes it's summer
My time of year
Stretched out on a blanket in the sand
Kids of all ages diggin' Disneyland
Rappin' on the C.B. radio in your van
We'll give a big "10-4" to the truckin' man
Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes it's summer
My time of year
Yes it's summer
My time of year
Young boys playin' stick ball in the street
Fire hydrants help to beat the heat
Old man feeding pigeons in the square
Nighttime finds young lovers walking there
Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes it's summer
My time of year
Yes it's summer
My time of year
In Atlantic City or out in Malibu
Or any where between, I'm telling you
When you feel those balmy breezes on your face
Summer time is the best time any place
Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes it's summer
My time of year
Yes it's summer
My time of year
