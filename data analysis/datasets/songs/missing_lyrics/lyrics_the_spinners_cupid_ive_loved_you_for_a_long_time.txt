Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now, I don't mean to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix
So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Now Cupid, if your arrow make a love storm for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us, her heart we can steal
Help me if you will
So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my tears and let your arrow come near
Straight to my lover's heart for me
I know that you heard it before, but Cupid, don't go
What would we do if you didn't exist?
We can't be sure, but please don't ignore
Cupid the reason you're here
I know that you're feeling discouraged
You think no one cares about love
So Cupid, please do us a favor
Just pick up your bow and let your arrow go
Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
