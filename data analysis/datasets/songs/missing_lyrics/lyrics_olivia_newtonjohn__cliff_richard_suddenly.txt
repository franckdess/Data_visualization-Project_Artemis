She walks in and I'm suddenly a hero
I'm taken in
My hopes begin to rise

Look at me
Can't you tell
I'd be so thrilled to see
The message in your eyes?

You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there

Suddenly
The wheels are in motion
And I
I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I
I'm ready to take all my chances with you

And how can I
Feel you're all that matters?
I'd rely on anything you say

I'll take care that no illusions shatter
If you dare to say what you should say

You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there

Suddenly
The wheels are in motion
And I
I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I
I'm ready to take all my chances with you

Why do I feel so alive when you're near?
There's no way any hurt can get through
Longing to spend every moment of the day with you
With you

Suddenly
The wheels are in motion
And I
I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I
I'm ready to take all my chances with you
