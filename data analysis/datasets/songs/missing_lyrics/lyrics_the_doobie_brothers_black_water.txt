Well, I built me a raft and she's ready for floating
Old Mississippi, she's calling my name
Catfish are jumping, that paddle wheel thumping
Black water keeps rolling on past just the same

Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Old black water, keep on rolling
Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
Yeah, keep on shining your light
Gonna make everything, pretty mama
Gonna make everything alright
And I ain't got no worries cause I ain't in no hurry at all
Well, if it rains, I don't care! Don't make no difference to me
Just take that street car that's going up town
Yeah, I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland
And dance a honky tonk
And I'll be buying everybody drinks all round

I'd like to hear some funky Dixieland
Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand
Take me by the hand, pretty mama
Come and dance with your daddy all night long
