Hello, hello? Baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Boy, the way you blowing up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, sorry, I cannot answer

It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause I'll be dancing, 'cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephoning me)
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
We're sorry
