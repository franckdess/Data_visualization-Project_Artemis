Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill

I want to love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I want to taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison


One look, (one look) could kill (could kill)
My pain, your thrill

I want to love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I want to taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison)
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison

Yeah!
Well, I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison) no
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep (poison) inside my brain
Poison (poison)
I don't want (poison) to break these chains
Poison (poison)
