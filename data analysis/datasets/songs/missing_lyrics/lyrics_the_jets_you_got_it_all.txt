I, I was a game he would play, he brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light you came my way one night
Just one look and I knew, you would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear, put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best? Don't you know, don't you know
You got it all over him, you got me over him
Honey it's true, there's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not, just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him
No, don't let him worry you so, once I met you I let go
Oh you can surely see, you're so much more to me
Just one look and I knew, you would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear, you're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best? Don't you know, don't you know
You got it all over him, you got me over him
Honey it's true, there's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not, just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him
You got it all over him, you got me over him
Honey it's true, there's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not, just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him
You got it all over him, you got me over him
Honey it's true there's just you
You must have been Heaven sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
