Outside, the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more
On the shore, a dream
Will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more
Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me
'Neath the waves
Through the caves of ours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend
Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do
Lovers too, so cast
Your seasons to the wind
And hold me, dear
Oh, hold me, dear
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, oh, we're all alone
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Owe it to the wind, my love
