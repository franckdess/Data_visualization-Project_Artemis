Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
"Where is she, tell me where?"

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul


And I know
If she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there

And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
That if she had me back again
I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul
