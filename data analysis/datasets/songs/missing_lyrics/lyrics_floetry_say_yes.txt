Just tell him
See I been watching you for a while
Your smile and stuff
But I don't know if I can
Be with you for the night
Is that all right, Is that all right... baby... baby

There is only one for me
You have made that possibility
We can take that step to see
If this is really gonna be
All you gotta do is say yes

All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby
Open up your mind just rest
I'm about to let you know
You make me so
All you gotta do is say yes

Loving you has taken time, taken time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognise the butterflies, inside me, Uh
Since it's gonna be made tonight, tonight
All you gotta do is say yes

Open up your mind just rest
