You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"

Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind?
'Cause each and every time you're near me, you give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You hold it all inside
If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real;
Tell me what's goin' on, tell me how you feel
'Cause, boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you
So come and get my love - it's all here for you

You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"

If you keep actin' this way, you're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play, you better hurry up
'Cause every time I come around and cruise around your way
I see you on the corner, but you don't know what to say
When I walk up to you, baby, you seem so shy
What's the problem, baby? Never had a girl like I?
I can see right through you, and you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together, 'cause you're running out of time!

You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," (Oh!)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" (No...)
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
(Don't you know, you tell me, "No, baby, no, baby, no, baby")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes..." ("Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby...")
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no," ("No, baby, no, baby, no, baby!")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby...")
(Just say yes)

You won't regret, I must confess
I'm really feelin' you
Anything you've ever wanted before is right here for you, for you
Don't worry what they say
Just bring your love my way
'Cause your friends can't do what I can for you
I don't wanna hear you say

(No...)
Baby, tell me (Yes..)
Tell me yes, don't tell me no, no (No...)
(Yes...)
You be sayin', "No...", (Don't tell me "no," no...)
When it's really, "Yes..." (Tell me what I wanna hear, yeah, yeah)
You be sayin', "No..." (Y-E-S, not N-O)
When it's really, "Yes..." (Oh, ooh, oh)

You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no"
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"
(You make me say "No, baby, no, baby, no, baby")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby")
You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" ("No, baby, no, baby, no, baby!")
When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" ("Yes, baby, yes, baby, yes, baby")
