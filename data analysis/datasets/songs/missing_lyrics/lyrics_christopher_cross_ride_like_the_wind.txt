It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again
And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind
And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old
It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again
And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
And I've got a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind
Gonna ride like the wind
Ride
Gonna ride like the wind
Gonna ride
