(verse 1)
A little ole' man was sittin' on a step
And a tear trickled own his cheek
I said, "What's the matter?"
He said, "A train just ran over me."
I said, "Hmm. How often does this happen?"
He said, "Everyday about this time."
I said, "Well, why do you just sit out here then?"
He said "Cause I cannot believe that this happened."
(pre-chorus)
I said, "Reach out, take my hand, you'll understand."
(chorus)
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, outta sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, outta sight
(verse 2)
Little ole' man was sittin' on the step, same ole' man
And a tear trickled down his cheek
I said, "What's the matter?"
He said, "A herd of elephants just stampeded over me."
I said, "Hmm" same "Hmm."
I said, "How often does this happen?"
He said, "Everyday, a half hour after the train runs over me."
(pre-chorus)
I said, "Reach out, take my hand, you'll understand."
(chorus)
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, outta sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, outta sight
(verse 3)
Little ole' man sittin' on a step, same ole' man
A tear trickled down his cheek
I said, "Hey, how ya doin' after that train ran over ya?"
He said, "WHAT train?"
I said, "The train that ran over ya a half hour before the elephants stampeded over ya."
He said, "What elephants?"
I said, "Hmm" same "Hmm."
He says, "You're a young boy."
Says, "Ya got a lot to learn."
(pre-chorus)
He says "Reach out, take my hand, you'll understand."
(chorus)
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, outta sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, outta sight
