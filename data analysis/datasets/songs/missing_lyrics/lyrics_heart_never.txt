Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know
We can't go on
Just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away
Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never, never, never
Never run away
Hey baby you know it's true
Why you bother lying
When you know that you want it to
Don't you dare deny me
Walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, let me go
We can't go on
Just running away
If we wait any longer
We will surely never get away
Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around
Never let them shoot us down
Never, never (no), never
Never run away
Never, no never, never
Never run away
Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know
We can't go on just running away
If we stay any longer
We will surely never get away
Whoa, never
Whoa, never
We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never
Whoa, never
Whoa, never
We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never
Whoa, never
Whoa, never
