Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised lands
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried "Forgive me for what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did"

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road, you gotta take me home

I drive by the homeless sleeping on
A cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read
Jesus Saves
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in, if there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in, oh Lord arise
(You take the high road and I'll take the low road)

Sometimes I wish I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then, yeah
And give me something to believe in, yea-yeah
