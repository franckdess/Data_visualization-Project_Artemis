Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep, blue sea
On a blue, blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes, holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear, blue sky
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again

Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again
