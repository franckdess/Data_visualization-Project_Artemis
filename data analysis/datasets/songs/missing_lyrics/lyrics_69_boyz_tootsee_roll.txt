(Verse 1)
I don't know what you've been told
It ain't the butterfly, it's the Tootsee Roll
A brand new dance SO
Grab a partner and get on the dance FLO'
And work them hips a lil' bit
Then do that dip a lil' bit
Oh yeah, you got it, now whip, baby, no buts about it
And you over there, with the long hair
Keep rollin' that derriere
Cause it ain't hard
Just a brand new dance for the 199Quad
69 in the place to be
Hey yo, 'Ski! What we came to see?
Cotton candy, sweetie, go
Let me see the Tootsee Roll!
