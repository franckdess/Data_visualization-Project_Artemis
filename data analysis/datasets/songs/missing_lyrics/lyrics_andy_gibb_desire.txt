Ah..... Ah....
We may be big or small or black or white , eternally
And black and white is you and me in a special light
We may be young or old or in between ,but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you
If you give it all away 
Make it mine ,ine , ine , ine , mine
You are desire , everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light
These are the golden years we get to live
We lead the way , tomorrow we can start today
In a special light
Love could be good or bad or in between
But this much I learn
Baby , you and I can learn
In a world that's rearranging it's reality
If you give it all away
Make it mine , ine , ine , ine , mine
You are desire , everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light
Ah...
And it's nice to light a fire
When it's cold outside
If you give it all away
Make it mine , ine , ine , ine , mine
You are desire , everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light
