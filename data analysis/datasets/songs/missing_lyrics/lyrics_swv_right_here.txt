S, The Double, The U, The V

Lately there seems to be
Some insecurities
About the way I feel
Where I wanna be
Boy ya know it's with you
No one can do
The things you do to me
Never to be mistaken
Long as it's love we're making
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain

But as long as I know
Boy time will show
Our love will grow
And I know

Love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here

True love some don't believe in
That's just what I'm givin'
I'm gonna keep it strong
I'll be holding on to you
No one can do me like you do
It's true
Sure as the sun is shining
Our love will keep on climbing
There's gonna be some rain
Gonna be some pain

But as long as I know
Boy time will show
Our love will grow
And I know

Love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here

S, W, S, V
S-S, W, Double-V, U
S, W, U, V-V

Love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here
Love will be right here
Be right here
Right here
Be right here
No fear
Have no fear
No tears
Love is here
