Walk out, girl, don't you walk out
We've got things to say
Talk out, let's have it talked out
And things will be okay

Girl, I don't want to fight
I'm a little bit wrong
You're a little bit right
I said girl, you know that it's true
It's a little bit me (A little bit me)
It's a little bit you, too

Don't know just what I said wrong
But girl, I apologized
Don't go, here's where you belong
So wipe the tears from your eyes

Girl, I don't want to fight
I'm a little bit wrong
You're a little bit right
I said girl, you know that it's true
It's a little bit me (A little bit me)
And it's a little bit you, too

Oh girl, I don't want to fight
I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
And I said girl, you know that it's true
It's a little bit me (A little bit me)
And it's a little bit you, too

It's a little bit me (Ah-ah, it's a little bit me)
It's a little bit you (Ah-ah, it's a little bit you)
Girl, I'm gone (Ah-ah, it's a little bit me)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah-ah, it's a little bit you)
Girl, I'm gone (Ah-ah, it's a little bit me)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah-ah, it's a little bit you)
Hey, girl (Ah-ah, it's a little bit me)
Hey, girl (Ah-ah, it's a little bit you)
Please don't go (Ah-ah)
