I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thug niggas, for my thug niggas
Uptown, baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck tonight?

I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beats, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5-0 Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko
From Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who want to ride it? Won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm big, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, Chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for
For my thug niggas, for my thug niggas
Uptown, baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot

I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep
Pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, ‘cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love
Got you screamin', "Punish me!"
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like
"Don't stop, get it, get it!"
