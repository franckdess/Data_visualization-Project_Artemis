(Man 1)
I need your help, I can't tell you what it is
You can ever ask me about it later, and were going to hurt some people
(Man 2)
.....Whose car are we gonna take?

Hands in the air
And open up the the drawer
I've got enough to eat, but I want get myself some more
You know a crib with two floors
3 whores, walking in the morning off the ocean
Washing upon the seashore, for sure
I know it's wrong to take your beeper phone
But I left the one own, on the dresser inside my home
Pressed to the side of a dome, lies the hide of my chrome
Shoot one on, but the tips the color of a cone
(What?)
Safety cones won't intimidate
But fuck it, he's champ of welter
Gimme, take that heavyweight
Skinny fake, shake and bake
Bout the size of Betty's cakes
Give me my weapon I'll take the entire nation
Outside the White House waiting for a fucking side of bacon
Looking at me like shouldn't be saying shit, are you serious?
Man my whole neighborhood is vacant

Yo It's a motherfucking stick up, a stick up
Its a motherfucking stick up, a stick up
Its a motherfucking stick up, yo did you hear me man, its a motherfucking stick up
Yo its a motherfucking stick up, its a stick up, a motherfucking stick up
Hah
Ayo, fuck it nigga give up

Remember back in high school
When they said skating was for white
Wayne went and got it, now they say the shit is tight
Like they use to tell everybody tight pants wasn't nice
Gangstas, rappers wear tight and now the shit is fucking right
Fuck tastemakers, all these contradicting dummies
Got you running to the store
And they taking all your money
And I ain't talking shit, I'm just pointing out the obvious
Fools got you lined for Jordan like you protesting lobbyists
Robbery shit quick like doom drinking guiness
Dennis the apprentice
Iller with a mic, kills with a sentence
Not pretend it's
Motherfuck Donald, his therapist and his motherfucking dentist
Wifey like "my god honey nadas such a menace"
He like, "Bitch close your mouth before Amir puts his dick in it"


They have to rob the people, need the maybach with bluetooth
People gotta suffer, that's not their causalty, that's you
Now That's a foolish excuse
Doesn't really matter when your trying to tell the truth
Sorry honesty in business doesn't have any use
If they accepted that as credit, I'd buy myself a coupe, with a missing roof
Show up to my local bar, to spit at you
Your shining man, my golden tooth
But fuck it, this just one song
Smoke and mirrors shit but the second got my lungs gone
Fuck this shit, I'm going going gone

Yo It's a motherfucking stick up
