I wanna tell you a story
Every man oughta know
If you want a little lovin'
You gotta start real slow
She's gonna love you tonight now
If you just treat her right now
Squeeze her real gentle
Gotta make her feel good
Tell her that you love her
Like you know you should
So if you don't treat her right
She won't love you tonight
If you practice my method
Just as hard as you can
You're gonna get a reputation
As a lovin' man
And you'll be glad every night
That you treated her right
