I don't know why, what I'm doing what I'm doing
See, baby I, apologize
For all the things that I've done, that I've done
See I know that I've been a fool for far too long
And baby, you don't have to go and run away
Just come back to papa
Please baby, baby, won't you stay?
If you really love me then why are you leaving me?

I can't think, think about this crazy day
I lose sleep just to daydream about you, baby

I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinking about you lately (crazy baby)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinking about you, baby (I don't know
What to do)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinking about you lately (crazy, crazy
Crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy) when I can't touch you
Crazy, crazy (I'm going crazy) when I can't hold you
Crazy, crazy, (I'm going crazy) when I can't see you again
(Said I'm going crazy)
(Said I'm going crazy)

I've finally realized, that you are my true love
And I had a lot of time to think, and you're all seem to keep thinking
To keep thinking of, yeah
And now I know I need you each and every day
I can't live without you, so don't run away
Baby, you say that you love me, so why'd you leave me? Why? (Why, why, why, why)

I can't think, think about this crazy day
I lose sleep just to daydream about you, baby (I'm going crazy)

I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just thinking about you lately (just to think)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just thinking about you baby
(I'm goin crazy, I'm going crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinking about you lately
I'm going crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy) when I  can't touch you (I'm going crazy)
Crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy), when I can't hold you
Crazy, crazy, when I can see again (if I can see you, if I can see you if I can see you, if I can see you)
If I can see you, if I can see you again
Then I would go, if I could see you again
I'd go crazy
