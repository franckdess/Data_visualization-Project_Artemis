Last night I, I saw you standing
And I started, started pretending
That I knew you, and you knew me too
And just like a Roni, you were too shy
But you weren't the only 'cause so was I
And I dreamed of you ever since
Now I built up my confidence
Girl next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say...

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name

I started to write you letters
But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey baby
But just like a baby I could not talk
And I tried to come closer, but could not walk
And I think of it every night
Oh I just could not get it right! Oh!
If we ever come close again
I'll know what I'll say then

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name

Oh girl...
One more chance with you again
And I will not let it go!
Oh please! Give me just one more chance for love, love, love, love

Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk?
I wanna talk to my baby
Come on and talk to me baby
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk?
Come on and talk to me baby
See I wanna know
You better tell me your name baby
Can we talk for a minute?
I wanna know, I wanna know
I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute?
