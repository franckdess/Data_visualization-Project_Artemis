I know a girl who's soft and sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want Candy
I want Candy

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Go to see her with her hair hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

I want Candy
I want Candy

I want Candy
I want Candy
I want Candy

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make her mine
Then I'll have Candy all the time

I want Candy
I want Candy

Woooo
