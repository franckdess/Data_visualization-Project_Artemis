I've been phoning
A-Night and morning
I heard you say:
"Tell him I'm not home"
Now you're confessing
But I'm still guessing
I've been your fool
For so, so long

Girl, don't lie
Just to save my feelings
Girl, don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong
Girl don't try
To make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave
Than never believe

If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
If this is it
(Ooh-wap)
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

You've been thinking
And I've been drinking
We both know that it's
Just not right
Now you're pretending
That it's not ending
You'll say anything
To avoid a fight

Girl, don't lie
And tell me that you need me
Girl, don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong
I'll be all right
A-One way or another
So let me go
Or make me want to stay

If this is it
Please let me know
(Ooh) If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so


(Ooh-wap) If this is it
(Ooh-woah) Please let me know
(Ooh) If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so
(If this is it
Please let me know)
I wanna know
(Ooh)
(If this is it)
If this is it
(Please let me know)
I gotta know
(Ooh)
(If this is it)
You better let me know
(Please let me know)
(Ooh)
Just say so
(If this is it
Please let me know
Ooh
If this is it
Please let me know
Ooh)
