Well, just look at that girl
With the lights comin' up in her eyes
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
All the guys on the corner stand back
And let her walk on by
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so fine
She's probably somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right
I heard her talkin' with her friend
When she thought nobody else was around
She said she's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
â€˜Cause when the cars and the signs and the streetlights
Light up the town
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so
She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
I try to shut my eyes
But I can't get her outta my sight
I know I'm gonna know her
But I gotta get over my fright
Well, I'm just gonna walk up to her
I'm gonna talk to her tonight
Ah
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Ah
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
