Uh, whoa, whoa
ReRe's got a new boyfriend (yeah, uh-uh)
ReRe and Kenny sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby (oh)
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby
Whoo!

I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a
I lover, lover, I lover, lover
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy

I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time
I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

Loverboy c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy c'mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you (yes, I do)
'Cause you affect me, you fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh
This stuff is starting now, oh
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, ooh
My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Candy!)
Simply put, you're the reason why (you're the reason why)
Even though I'm real shy, it's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you, indeed I do, just for you

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more (give it to me), touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (all night long)
(Strawberry) Loverboy, come on and take me
(Raspberry) Only you know how to make me
(All those good things)
(Diamonds and gumdrops)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
(That's what you seem to me)
Loverboy, come on and love me (oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me
(This stuff is starting, staring now)
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(Strawberry) Loverboy, come on and take me
(Raspberry) Only you know how to make me
(All those good things)
(Diamonds and gumdrops)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
(That's what you seem to me)
Loverboy, come on and love me (oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me (baby)
I enjoy the way you rock me...
