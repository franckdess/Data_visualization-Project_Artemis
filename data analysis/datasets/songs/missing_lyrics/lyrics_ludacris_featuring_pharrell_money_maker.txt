Shake, shake, shake your money maker
Like you were shaking it for some paper
It took your momma 9 months to make ya
Might as well shake what your momma gave ya
You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you'd look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money - money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet and
How everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can

Shake your money maker
Like somebody's bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you're afraid of shit
You know I got it
If you wanna come get it

Switch, switch, switch it from right to left
And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends as
You want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to hey
Luda - I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from your bottom to the top of your frame
And I - just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius
Yepp call me the renaissance man get up and
I stay harder then a cinderblock man
Hey I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I've been meaning to tell that I really must thank ya when you

Rock rock, rock it an make it work, girl
Please don't stop it until it hurts, girl
You - you been looking a little tipsy
So if you could just shake it a little this way
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
You the center of attention that is distracting the squad
Cause everybody in the campus like - OH MY GOD she can
