Never had a doubt in the beginning
Never a doubt
Trusted you true in the beginning
I loved you right through
Arm in arm we laughed like kids
At all the silly things we did
You made me promises, promises
Knowing I'd believe
Promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Second time around, I'm still believing
The words that you said
You said you'd always be here
"In love forever" still repeats in my head
You can't finish what you start
If this is love it breaks my heart
You made me promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe?
Arm in arm we laughed like kids
At all the silly things we did
But you can't finish what you start
If this is love it breaks my heart
You made me promises, promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe
All of your promises
You knew you'd never keep
Promises, promises
Why do I believe?
Promises
Promises
Promises
Promises
Promises
