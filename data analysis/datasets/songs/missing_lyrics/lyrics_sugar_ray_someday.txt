Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and they'll fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

Some say, better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me
Some way, when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and they fade away
And fade they away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

Someone said we tried too long (Someday will pass me by)
Someone said we got it all wrong (Someday, I wonder why)
Someone said we tried too long (Someday will pass me by)
Is there a place where I belong? (Someday will)

So far
So long
So far away
So far
So wrong
So far away away away

Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and they'll fade away

And they fade away (repeats many times until it fades out)
