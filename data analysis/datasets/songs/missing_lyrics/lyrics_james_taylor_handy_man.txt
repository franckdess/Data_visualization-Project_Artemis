Hey girls, gather round
Listen to what I'm putting down
Hey baby, I'm your handy man
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can
If your broken heart should need repair
Then I am the man to see
I whisper sweet things
You tell all your friends
They'll come running to me
Here is the main thing that I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts
I know that I truly can
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Oh now, they'll come running to me
Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, baby
I'm your handy man
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Come
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come
Come
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's me
(Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come)
I'm your handy man
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's me
(Come-a, come-a, come-a, come-a, come, come)
I'm your handy man
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
