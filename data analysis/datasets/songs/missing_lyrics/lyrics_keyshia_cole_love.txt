I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing gamesâ€”what's this all about?
And I can't believe you're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found, found you

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, please tell me, baby
Why you go so far away, why you go...

Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found, I found you

I found you
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty, my heart, my soul, can't go on
Go on, baby, without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around, say you're here to stay
With me, boy, I don't want you to leave me
I...I need you

Love, never knew what I was missin' (I never knew)
But I knew once we start kissin', I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found, I found...
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin', I found...
