Toe to toe dancing, very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
Back to back sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24 hour shopping in rapture

Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinning I said "My My"
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Fran√ßois c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes the man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
And toe to toe, don't move too slow
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure, take a tour
Through the sewer, don't strain your brain
Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop to the punk rock

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on and now he's gone
Back up to space where he won't have a hassle
With the human race and you hip hop
And you don't stop, just blast off
Sure shot cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars
And eating bars and now he only eats guitars, get up
