No, I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

Oh, little darling of mine
I can't for the life of me
Remember a sadder day
I know they say let it be
But it just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

No, I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

Oh, little darling of mine
I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

But I would not give you false hope (No)
On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

Oh, the mother and child reunion is only a motion away
Oh, the mother and child reunion is only a moment away (Oh)
Oh, the mother and child reunion is only a motion away
Oh, the mother and child reunion is only a moment away (Oh)
Oh, the mother and child reunion, oh, is only a motion away
Oh, the mother and child reunion is only a moment away, way, way, way
