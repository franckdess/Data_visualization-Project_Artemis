These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, long to hold you again
The hurting's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, my baby, no no
You gave a promise to me, yeah
You broke it, and you broke it, oh no

These eyes, watched you bring my world to an end
This heart could not accept and pretend
The hurting's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah
