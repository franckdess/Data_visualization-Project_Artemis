Is it so hard
To satisfy your senses?
You found out to love me
You have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling
Along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do?
Baby, tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you?
Attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you?
Existing just to kiss you?
Like the way I do?
Tell me, does she want you?
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you?
Electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you?
Seduce you and affect you?
Like the way I do?
Like the way I do?
Can I survive
All the implications?
Even if I tried
Could you be less than an addiction?
Don't you think I know
There's so many others
Who would beg steal and lie
Fight kill and die
Just to hold you hold you
Hold you like I do?
Ooh, baby, tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you?
Attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you?
Existing just to kiss you?
Like the way I do?
Tell me, does she want you?
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you?
Electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you?
Seduce you and affect you?
Like the way I do?
Oh, nobody loves you
Like the way I do
Nobody wants you
Like the way I do
Nobody needs you
Like the way I do
Nobody aches
Nobody aches just to hold you
Like the way I do
No, no, no
Tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you?
Attract and captivate you?
Baby, baby, tell me, does she miss you?
Existing just to kiss you?
Like the way I do?
No, tell me, does she want you?
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you?
Electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you?
Seduce you and affect you, baby?
Like the way I do?
No, like the way I do?
Oh-ho... yeah
