If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws
If I couldn't be strong
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

Right about now
If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?
Or is you gonna say goodbye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life
Shawty, would it be alright?
Come on, show me that you are down

Now tell me, would you really ride for me?
(Would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me, would you die for me?
(Tell me, would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me, would you really cry for me?
(Would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything (Wassup)
I wanna know, would you stick around?

If I got locked away
And we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

Skiddly dong, dong, dong, dang
All I want is somebody real, who don't need much
A gyal I know that I can trust
To be here when money low
If I did not have nothing else to give but love
Would that even be enough? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
