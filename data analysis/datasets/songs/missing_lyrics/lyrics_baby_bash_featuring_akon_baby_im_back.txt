 :
Don't look no farther!
Baby im back (yeah)
Im here to cater to you (any thing that you want me: do ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)
Now im back in a flesh
Feelin so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, im back in your zone
Baby im back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can lie im on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of lake haewa
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
These words comin out the speaker, true love is off the meter

I was gone for a minute but now im home
Kids forget me for being a rolling stone
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone
Let my start your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so salty and I get respect
You don't have to look no farter, you dealin with the hoe with your lada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter

I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh) x3
Now im back let me hit it (oooohhh) x3
