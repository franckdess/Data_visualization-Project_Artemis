Paint the town
Take a bow
Thank everybody
You're gonna do it again
You are the few, the proud
You are the antibody
Mind, soul and zen

And the world's a stage
(And the world's a faze)
And the end is near
So push rewind
Just in time
Thank anybody
You're gonna do it again

The way the you walk
It's just the way that you talk
Like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning comes

Take your knocks
Shake them off
Duck everybody
You're gonna take them again
You are you foe
Your friend
You are the paparazzi
You are the tragedian

And the world's a craze
(And the world's a faze)
And the end is near
So push rewind
Just in time
Thank anybody
You're gonna do it again

The way the you walk
It's just the way that you talk
Like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning comes

And when it comes it moves so slow
Kinda like it's saying I told you so
Looking back before she goes
Tomorrow's gonna hurt

And the world's a stage
(And the world's a faze)
And the end is near
So push rewind
Just in time
Thank anybody
You're gonna do it again

The way the you walk
It's just the way that you talk
Like it ain't no thing
And every single day is just a fling
Then the morning comes
