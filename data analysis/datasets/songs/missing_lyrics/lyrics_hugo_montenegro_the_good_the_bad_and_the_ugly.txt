Here is the tale of the boy standing in front of you
Not one word is exaggerated -- entirely true
A four square in chemistry, my agenda tonight
As I rock the house left, and a I rock the house right
I can't fly, I can't dance
And I don't like any bands
Listen up, 'cause I am Atom, I am the sequencing man
Where I want is where I go
I'm always armed with a burrito
Listen up, 'cause I am Atom, I am the sequencing man
I travel the world with my band in a box
And I rock 10 times harder than your average punk rock band
I'm almost done, I'm almost through
I hope to God I'm not boring you
I often do the number 2
I am the always often pooping Jew
I can't fly, I can't dance
And I don't like any bands
Listen up, 'cause I am Atom, I am the sequencing man
Where I want is where I go
I'm always armed with a burrito
Listen up, 'cause I am Atom, I am the sequencing man
I can't fly, I can't dance
And I don't like your band
Listen up, 'cause I am Atom, I am the sequencing man
Where I want is where I go
I'm always armed with a burrito
Pay attention, 'cause I am Atom, I am the sequencing man
