Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume
Oh, gods and years will rise and fall
And there's always something more
It's lost in talk, I waste my time
And it's all been said before
While further down
Behind the masquerade the tears are there
I don't ask for all that much
I just want someone to care…
That's right now
Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Come on out beneath the shining sun
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yes
Oh yeah
It's king and queen and we must go down now
Beyond the chandelier
Where I won't have to speak my mind
And you won't have to hear
Shreds of news and afterthoughts
And complicated scenes
We'll weather down behind the light
And fade like magazines…
I…I love is alright now
Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Hey, hey, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume
Oh now, meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Let me see you smiling back at me
Hey, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Hold me tight and love and loving's free
Aw…right
O…kay
