Uh!
Huh, will you listen to how smooth it is?
Hey, uh, listen to them

(Warm it up, Kris) I'm about to
(Warm it up, Kris) 'Cause that's what I was born to do
(Warm it up, Kris) I'm about to
(Warm it up, Kris) 'Cause that's what I was born to do

So many times I heard you rhyme but you can't touch this
I'm kicking the type of flow that makes you say, "You're too much, Kris"
So feel the fire of the one they call the Mac Dad
The fire's what I pack and what I pack is real bad
I'd like to grab ahold of your soul and never let go
Do the jump, do the Hump, and say ("Ho!")
Now that's the state of mind I'm in, huh...
With rhyme after rhyme I win
The Mac (The Mac)
Known for breaking 'em off something
They laying in the back and front keeping your speakers pumping
The miggida-miggida-miggida Mac came to get 'em warm
And my pants to the back, that's my everyday uniform
You little cream puff Mac Daddy wannabe
Keep dreaming 'cause a Mac you will never be
So all y'all with the Dr. Seuss riddles
You can get the finger - the middle

Ay, yo Kris, kick it

I caught you on the scope (the scope)
Peepin' out my rhymes that's this dope (it's dope)
And for you there's no hope
My name (is what?) Daddy Mac, baby
Totally Krossed Out catching all the ladies
At the age I be, I should be playing with toys
Instead I put my head into making you make noise
That's how I kick it, that's my everyday life and
I rehearse to keep it sharp as a knife, man
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messing with
'Cause when I put the mic in my hand I start wrecking it
They call me the D-A-double-D-Y-M-A-C
And there ain't another brother bad as me
When I (let go) something from the (ghetto), word
A little brother kicking rhymes like you never ever heard
Daddy of them all, shooting the gift like a gun
Showing suckers how it's done

Yeah, now you all know (what's up?)
And the Macs are all that (yeah)
And we gonna kick one more verse for y'all

So many times I heard you rhyme but you can't touch this

Kris Kross show 'em how it's done

Warm it up, Kris (repeat until end)
