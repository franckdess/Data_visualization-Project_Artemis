Oh, yeah
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Yeah, baby)
I'm just a love machine
A hugging kissing fiend
I think it's high time you knew
Whenever I think of you
My mind blows a fuse
(Baby)
When I look in your eyes
My meter starts to rise
And I become confused
My motor cranked electric goes
When I'm sitting next to you
Electricity starts to flow
And my indicator starts to glow
(I, I)
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Oh, yeah)
I'm just a love machine
(Yeah, baby)
A hugging kissing fiend
La, la la la la
La la la la, la la
La la la la la
La la la, la la la
(I, I)
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Oh, yeah)
I'm just a love machine
(Yeah baby)
A hugging kissing fiend
I'm gentle as a lamb
I'm not that hard to program
There's no way that you can lose
Chassis fits like a glove
I've got a button for love
That you've got to use
(Push it, push it baby)
If you look into my power
I am sure you can find out how
To turn me on just set my dial
And let me love you for a little while, ooh
(I, I)
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Oh, yeah)
I'm just a love machine
(Yeah baby)
A hugging kissing fiend
La, la la la la
La la la la, la la
La la la la la
La la la, la la la
Push it push it bab
Yeah, ah, ah
(I, I)
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Oh, yeah)
I'm just a love machine
(Yeah baby)
A hugging kissing fiend
(I, I)
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Oh, yeah)
I'm just a love machine
(Yeah baby)
A hugging kissing fiend
Oh, yeah
Love machine
Earth quacking
Sole shaking
Love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
Love machine
Earth quacking, sole shaking
Love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
Oh, yeah
Love machine
Earth quacking, sole shaking
Love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
Love machine
Earth quacking
Sole shaking
Love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
