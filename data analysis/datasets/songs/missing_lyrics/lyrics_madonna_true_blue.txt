I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes, but I never knew love before
Until you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships, but no matter where I go
You're the one for me, baby
This I know, 'cause it's...

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh-so many times
Those tear drops, they won't fall again
I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said...

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

No more sadness
I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's...
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's...

True, so if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm going to be true blue, baby, I love you

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's...
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's...
