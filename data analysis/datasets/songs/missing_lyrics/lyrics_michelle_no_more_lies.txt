Hello?
Hello? Hello?
'Course you're the only girl
You're all I think about
You're the only girl for me
You're all I think about
You're special
You know I love you
You know I love you

You say you love me
And I think that is true
But every night my girlfriend tells me
I should watch you
Now I say I trust you
But I want you to know
I'm not a sucker;
Chill out-your nose is growing, Pinocchio
So now I'm leaving
And you know I tried
All right, baby, no more lies
Do-do-doo-ooh-ooh
Do-do-doo-ooh-ooh
Do-do-do-do-do-ooh-ooh
You say no more lies
And I'll try to understand
But there's a little exaggeration
In almost every man
Now I say I trust you
But I want you to know
Want you to know
Sounds like you're cryin' wolf, babe-
I think it's time for me to go
So now I'm leaving
And you know I tried
All right, baby, no more lies
But you don't appreciate
The time I take
All right baby, no more lies

Hello? You're the only girl for me
No more lies
You're all I think about;
'Course you're the only girl;
You're special
