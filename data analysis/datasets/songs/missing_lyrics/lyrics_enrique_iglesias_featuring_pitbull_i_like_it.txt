Set the club on fire, just go (We just go, go, go)
(We just, club is on fire) Enrique, holla at them like

Girl, please excuse me if I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night we can really let it go
My girlfriend's out of town and I'm all alone
Your boyfriend's on vacation and he doesn't have to know

No, oh-oh, oh-oh
No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
No, oh-oh, oh-oh
Shout it loud, scream it loud, let me hear you go

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I-I-I like it

Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever

Girl, please excuse me if I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm tryna keep my hands off, but you're begging me for more
'Round, 'round, 'round, give a low, low, low
Let the time time pass cause we're never getting old

No, oh-oh, oh-oh
No one can do it better, turn around, I'll give you more
No, oh-oh, oh-oh
Shout it loud, scream it loud, let me hear you, go!

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I-I-I like it

Go DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami Boy, you know how we play
I ain't playing with you, but I wanna play with you
Give me, got me good, now watch me
It's a different species, get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James
Equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle and let them know that it's on
Pa' fuera, pa' la calle
Dale mamita, tirame ese baile
Dale mamita, tirame ese baile
I see you watching me, you see me watching you
I love the way you move, I like them things you do, like

Don't stop, baby, don't stop, baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop, baby, won't stop, baby
Until you get enough

Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever

Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I-I-I like it
Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I-I-I like it

Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever
