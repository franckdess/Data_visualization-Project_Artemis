What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?"

Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
