It's been so long that I haven't seen your face
I'm trying to be strong, but the strength I have is washing away
It won't be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you what's been on my mind

Girl I know, mistakes were made between us two
And we showed our eyes that night even said some things weren't true
Watch you go? And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was' cause you were my Homie, lover, and friend

I can't lie (Miss you much)
Watching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)
Till I get you back I'm gon' try (Yes, I miss you much)
Cuz you are the apple of my eye (Girl, I miss you much)
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watching everyday that goes by (I miss you much)
Till I get you back I'm gon' try (Yes I miss you much)
Cuz you are the apple of my eye (Girl, I miss you much)

I want you to fly with me (Want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (Miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (Wish you could dine with me)
The one that'll grind with me (Said the one that will grind with me)
I want you to fly with me (Want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (Oh, miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (Wish you could dine)
The one that'll grind with me (Oh, the one that'll grind)...
