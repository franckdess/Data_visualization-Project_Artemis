I heard the weatherman
Predict a sunny day
He did not mean to lie
I look outside it's raining anyway
I guess I can live with a rainy day
Cause in the scheme of things
You're bound lose a few
Even your best-made plans
Before you know it, they are falling through
But that couldn't happen to me oooh and you
This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
My Ma she used to say
Beware the tender trap
If you get caught in one
Be sure you notice where your heart is at
Don't take chances with things
Things like that, oh, oh
This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
This time I'm in it for love
Baby, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
Crazy, baby
But how could I possibly lose
Ain't no way I could I lose
This time I'm in it for you
This time I'm in it for love
