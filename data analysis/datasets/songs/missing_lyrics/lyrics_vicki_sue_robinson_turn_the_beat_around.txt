Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Blow horns you sure sound pretty
Your violins keep moving to the nitty gritty
When you hear the scratch of the guitars scratchin'
Then you'll know that rhythm carries all the action
Whoa

Turn the beat around (Turn it around, yeah)
Love to hear percussion (yeah yeah hey hey!)
Turn it upside down (hey hey hey hey yeah)
Love to hear percussion (my my my my my)
Love to hear it (GOT TO HEAR IT!)
Turn the beat around (go on go on go on girl!)
Love to hear the percussion (move your feet when you feel the beat, yeah)
Turn it upside down (HEY! yeah yeah)
Love to hear percussion (whoa!)
Love to hear it

Flute player, play your flute 'cause I know
That you want to get your thing off
But you see I've made up my mind about it
It's got to be the rhythm, no doubt about it, whoa whoa
Cause when the guitar player start playing
With the syncopated rhythm, with the scratch, scratch, scratch
Makes me wanna move my body, yeah, yeah, yeah
And when the drummer starts beating that beat
He nails that beat with the syncopated rhythm
With the rat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat on the drums, hey!

Turn the beat around (ooooh I'm talkin' 'bout the beat)
Love to hear percussion (Ah my my my my my)
Turn it upside down (ooooh yeah)
Love to hear the percussion (love the hear the beat nah nah)
Love to hear it
Love to hear it (WHOA!)
Love to hear it
Love to hear it (HEY....!!)
Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it
Love to hear it
Love to hear it
