There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't his
It sure ain't no surprise

Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge

There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister you're a better man than I

Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge

Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it was would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again

Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I'd would rather be a hanging on

Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge

Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself 
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself at all
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself 
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself 
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling
