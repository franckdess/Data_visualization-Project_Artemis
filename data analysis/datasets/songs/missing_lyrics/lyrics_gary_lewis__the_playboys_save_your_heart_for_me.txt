Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself a summer fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you and
Save your heart for me
When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under starlit skies
Please don't let stars get in your eyes, just
Save your heart for me
When you're all alone, far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you-ou
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new
When the autumn winds begin to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know, so
Save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me
Brief instrumental with whistling-first two lines of a verse
Please remember I'm in love with you so
Save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me
