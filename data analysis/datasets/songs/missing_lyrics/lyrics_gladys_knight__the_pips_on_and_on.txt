Bet your life I'll be, yeah
A better woman, you see
All because you proved out to be
A better man for me
You build me up with so much affection
(You build me up with so much affection)
And you make me realize my needs
(And you make me realize my needs)
We seem to move in the right direction
(Seem to move in the right direction)
Makin' love, makin' love

How can I
How can I show you how
I wanna prove all my love
But I'm so afraid
To take a part
Don't break my heart
The way so many lovers do

So good I feel
'Cause our love's for real
Having tons of fun
Since our love's begun
Huggin' and a-lovin'
On and on
Gettin' with the kissin'
On and on
Chills I feel whenever you're near
Stickin' like a glue
Keep on lovin' you

(On and on)
On and on
Keep on groovin'
(On and on)
We gotta go
Keep on movin'
Keep on groovin'
(On and on)
On and on, hey, hey, hey
(On and on)
On and on
We gotta go

I know you feel like I feel
That's why we've got a love that's real
So let's keep on groovin' the way we do
Let's just keep on movin' and we're gonna make it through, ha
Huggin' and a-lovin'
Huggin' and a-lovin'
Gettin' with the kissin'
Gettin' with the kissin'
Gettin' with the kissin'
Gettin' with the kissin'
Huggin' and a-lovin'
Huggin' and a-lovin'
Huggin' and a-lovin'
Gettin' with the kissin'
