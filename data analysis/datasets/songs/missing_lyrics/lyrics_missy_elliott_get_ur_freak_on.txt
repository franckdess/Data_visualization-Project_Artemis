Missy be puttin' it down, I'm the hottest 'round
I told y'all motherfuckers, y'all can't stop me now
Listen to me now, I'm lastin' twenty rounds
And if you want me (nigga) then come on, get me now
Is you with me now? Then biggie, biggie bounce
I know you dig the way I sw-sw-switch my style
Holla
People sing around
Now people gather 'round, now people jump around

Quiet! (Shhh) Hush your mouth, silence when I spit it out
(Hah-choo!) In your face, open your mouth, give you a taste
Holla
Ain't no stoppin' me, copy written so don't copy me
Y'all do it sloppily and y'all can't come close to me
I know you feel me now, I know you hear me loud
I scream it loud and proud, Missy gon' blow it down
People gon' play me now, in and outta town
'Cause I'm the best around with this crazy style

Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
Go, get your freak on, go, get your freak on
