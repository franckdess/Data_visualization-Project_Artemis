Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face?

Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

No-nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
No, this pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me?

Can you take it all?
Can you take it all away?
The pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me
Take it all away
This pain you gave to me...
