Chorus:
(Alan Z): If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
(DJ Xross) Ooh all my boys close to me
And all them other boys where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
(Alan) That's how it post to be
(Xross) That's how it post to be
(Alan) That's how it post to be
(Both) Everything good like it post to be

Pull up to the club and it go up
Make your girl fall in love when I show up
It's not my fault she want to know me
She told me you was just a homie
She came down like she knew me
Gave it up like a groupie
And that's facts, no printer
Cold boy turn the summer to the winter
She save me in her phone as bestie
But I had her screaming oooh
Yo girl wasn't supposed to text me
You want to know how I know what I know
Chorus

Got these girls in my section, finna blow up
Alan Z got them wet when I roll up
You can see it in their eyes and lips, their thighs and hips
When she pop it tell her hold up
Better believe she gone leave with a real singer
I dick her down can't put it down like I do
I get to bussin' no discussion, gotta deal with it
Team us we ain't worried about you
Murder she wrote
When I hit it I'ma kill it I'ma get it like
Murder she wrote
You want to know how I know what I know

I'm a magnet to anybody with ovaries
If she go toe to toe with me, she gon' see I'm a total freak
Totally, young dirty bastard reminiscent of ODB
Eat it like groceries, could give it to Jhene Aiko with ease
Like Iâ€™m 'post to be
Got fans making social media posts of me
Buzzing more than locally, from Atlanta to overseas
If you wanna roll with me, just Say Yes like Floetry
Get you off tonight, on and off the mic, banging over beats
DJ Xross:
Banging over beats, spitting rhymes and poetry
Senpai notice me, and she be all like OMG
Ya girl all over me, I check her out like groceries
Her assets now my property cuz she won't let go of me
Chorus
