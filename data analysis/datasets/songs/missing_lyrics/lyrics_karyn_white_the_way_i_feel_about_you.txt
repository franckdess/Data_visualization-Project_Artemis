Day after day
Just thinking about you
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Could this be love I'm feeling for you?
I've never felt this way before, no

I made a wish upon a shooting star
And, baby, here you are
Just you and me
That's the way it should be
My heart is waiting, it's an open door
Each day I'm gonna love you more
Of this I'm for sure
That's the way I feel about you

Bye-bye cloudy days
Sunshine's here to stay
Tell the world
That's the way I feel about you
Happy days are here
Whenever you're near
This is clear
That's the way I feel about you
I feel about you

I'm so satisfied with you in my life
You're everything I've dreamed of
Ooh, and it feels so good when I'm in your arms
Nothing even matters as long as you're loving me, yeah

I made a wish upon a shooting star
And, baby, here you are
Just you and me
That's the way it really should be
My heart is waiting, it's an open door
Each day I'm gonna love you more
Of this I'm sure
That's the way I feel about you

Bye-bye cloudy days
Sunshine's here to stay
Tell the world
That's the way I feel about you
Happy days are here
Whenever you're near
This is clear
That's the way I feel about you
Bye-bye cloudy days
Sunshine's here to stay
Tell the world
That's the way I feel about you
Happy days are here
Whenever you're near
This is clear
That's the way I feel about you
The way I feel about you, uh-uh-uh
The way I feel about you, uh-uh-uh
All about you

Every time you hold me in your arms
I look into your eyes and I see happiness
(And my heart just can't deny) what I'm feelin' (deep inside)
I love what you do when you do all the things that you do to me, yeah

Bye-bye cloudy days
Sunshine's here to stay
Tell the world
That's the way I feel about you
Happy days are here
Whenever you're near
This is clear
