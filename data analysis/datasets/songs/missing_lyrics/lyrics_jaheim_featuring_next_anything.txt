Yea ooh yea yea yea yea

You can have anything I got
All of me right on the spot
Da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da
Da,da,da,da,da
You can have anything I own
Work my fingers all the way to the bone
Da,da,da,da,da,da,da,da
Da,da,da,da,da

Now baby I don't wanna be fictitious
Saying I can get you anything is ridiculous
But anything you ask if its anywhere near my grasp
It's yours, Oh yea
Now I don't got fancy cars or diamond rings
Lord knows I will if I make it with this singing thing
Hold on, have faith in me
Cause anything I have is yours, baby


Girl I know you wanna roll a Lexus
A Lexus with a mansion down in Texas
It's more like apartment 8 cellular is prepaid
But baby it's all okay
I can't do all the things I wanna do
But I can love you and I can stay true
I'll give you my last dime
Spend all my time
It's yours whatever is mine...
You can have anything you want


Now I don't have no LS to drive
(But I'm a man with a whole lot of plans and a lot of love inside)
Just believe and pray, hold on to me and say stay
(I can't handle you leaving me)
Just dream (dream) dream with Jaheim
I'll work overtime anytime
(Just to give you peace of mind)
Please just believe, everything and anything
All of me baby,baby,baby,baby


Baby you can have anything you want

Anything you want, anything you need
Anything I have baby girl just ask
Anything you want anything you need...
