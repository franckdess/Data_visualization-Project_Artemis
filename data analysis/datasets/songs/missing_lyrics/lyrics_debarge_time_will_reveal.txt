What can I do ?
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you know for sure that your the apple of my eye girl
Fulfillment of my dreams, time , will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you, it wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But is it good to know you do

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time

I tell you I love you
But you won't believe its true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you, it wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But is it good to know you do, aah
