Hourglass shape make the place go "oooh"
Waistline makes my soldier salute
I'm a brute (brute) high from ya high heel game
High heels push up ya ass last name
And you livin in the fast lane, eyes like an angel
Goddess, watch my girl and how she hot dress
Spotless, hotness bad to the bone
Make me wanna bone, put me in a triple-X zone (zone)
Lames don't know how to talk to you
So let me walk, with you, hold my hand

Not like a hooker, but more like a princess
Queen, empress, president pull
Any way ya goin' off cause you're beautiful, okay?
