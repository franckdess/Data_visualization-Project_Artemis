Imagine
Cash cold, that's what I need
These bill collectors, they ring my phone
They bother me when I'm not at home
Ain't go no time to be fooling round
Feet will touch the floors and I get on down, you see
I want money, lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money, lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich for a little love, peace and happiness
I want my cake, wanna eat it too
I want the stars and the silver moon
I spend my money on lottery
My favorite number is 1 2 3, you see
I want money, lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money, lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich for a little love, peace and happiness
Every way rich
Love peace and happiness
I want all the things that lovers do
A pocketful of dreams come true
These are things you can not find
That'll keep you satisfied and rich
Here is what your gonna do
Say oh I say uh uh
Got to be baby
I just wanna be rich, I just wanna be
Cause baby I want money, lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money, lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why
I wanna be rich
I wanna be rich
I wanna be rich
I wanna be rich for a little love, peace and happiness
Play baby there is lots and lots for everyone
I wanna be rich
