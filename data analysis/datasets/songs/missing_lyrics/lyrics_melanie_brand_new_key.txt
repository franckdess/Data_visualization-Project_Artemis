I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you've got something I need
Well, I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them on to see
I've been looking around awhile
You've got something for me
Oh I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I ride my bike I rollerskate don't drive no car
Don't go too fast but I go pretty far
For somebody who don't drive
I've been all around the world
Some people say I've done alright for a girl
Oh, yeah yeah
I asked your mother if you were at home
She said yes, but you weren't alone
Sometimes I think that you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you've got something I need
Well I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them on to see
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Oh I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key
