Hey, say, wait a minute
Where you going with that suitcase
Wait a minute, listen
All right, well, you don't have
To answer, just listen
I don't mind when you say
That you're going away
I just don't wanna be lonely
And I don't care if we
Share only moments a day
I just don't wanna be lonely
I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love
I can't give when you're gone
When you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely
I'd rather be loved
I don't mind when the tide
Sets the sun to the moon
I just don't wanna be lonely
Let the stairs find you there
Waiting at the end of the room
I just don't wanna be lonely
I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love
I can't give when you`re gone
When you're gone
I don't want to be lonely
I just wanna be loved, sugar
Come on
I just want to be loved
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Ooh, Lord, have mercy
I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love
I can't give when you`re gone
When you're gone
I don't want to be lonely
I wanna be loved, baby
Yeah, come on
Gimme that sweet love, sugar
I wanna be loved, baby
Gimme that love, sugar
Gimme that sweet, sweet
Sweet love, sugar
Gimme, gimme, gimme
That love, baby
I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
I don't wanna be lonely, baby
No, no, no
Gimme that love, sugar
Come on, I don't wanna be lonely
