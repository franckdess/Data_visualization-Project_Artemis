You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never, my love
(Ah) Never, my love
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never, my love
(Ah) Never, my love
What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you? (On you)
(Da da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da)
Never, my love
Never, my love
You say you fear I'll change my mind
I won't require you
Never, my love (Never, my love)
Never, my love (Never, my love)
How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me? (With me, with me)
Never, my love (Never, my love)
Never, my love (Never, my love)
Never, my love (Never, my love)
Never, my love (Never, my love)
