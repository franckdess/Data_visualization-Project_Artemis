Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
I know when to face the truth
And I know when the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now forever
Baby, I finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever

We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay
It's all up to you to tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that

I don't wanna lose you
Lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
