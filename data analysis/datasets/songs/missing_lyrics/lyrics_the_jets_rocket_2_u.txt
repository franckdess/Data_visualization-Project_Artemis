Baby, baby
When I called you on the phone today
You sounded frantic when you said
Come over right away
Oh, baby, baby
Won't you say what's on your mind?
Your TV set is acting up
And you don't understand
You're so upset
Because you can't watch All My Children
And you wonder
If there's something I can do for you
Well
All that I can say

Baby
I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby
I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do

Don't call me when your car
Just can't get into second gear
Or when your kitchen sink
Is shooting water in your ear
Oh, baby, baby
I have told you this before
Is there a special reason
That you just can't understand
I'm not the one to call
When you need a heavy man
Unless whatever needs fixing, girl
Is you
And I just have to say


Don't call me
When your toaster won't pop up
Don't call me
Just to cut your lawn
Don't call me
When your radio cuts off
In the middle of your favorite song
Don't call me when your shower just went
Uh-uh, no, baby
Don't call me
I think I told you this
About a million times
You know, it's not my cup of tea

I can rocket 2 u
The only thing I can do
I can rocket all night
I can rocket 2 u, baby
Let me rocket 2 ya, oh yeah
Just a little bit more
Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do
Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do
Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do
