Big old Ruby Red Dress
Wanders 'round the town
Talking to herself now
Sometimes sitting down
Don't you get too close now
Ruby runs away
Poor old Ruby Red Dress
Born on a sorry day
I can hear her say
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Yes, leave me
Leave me
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
God, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Oh, leave me
Leave me
Big old Ruby Red Dress
Everybody laughs
Say she's got no future
And never made no past
Something hurt that Ruby
Something she can't bare
You look at her real close now
You see a little tear
When she says now
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
God, leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Please leave me
Leave me
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Oh leave me
Leave me
Some folks say some farm boy
Oh, from Tennessee
Taught it all to Ruby
Then just let her be
Her daddy tried to hide it
Tried to keep things cool
But something happened to Ruby
She broke down to a fool
Who just said now
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Yes leave me
Leave me
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
Now leave me alone
God, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Please leave me
Leave me
Leave me alone
Won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone
