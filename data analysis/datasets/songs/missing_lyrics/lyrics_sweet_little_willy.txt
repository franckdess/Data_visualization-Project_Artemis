{Intro}
North side , east side
Little Willy, Willy wears the crown
He's the king around town
Dancing, glancing
Willy drives them silly with
His star shoe shimmy shuffle down
Way past one, and feeling alright
Cause with little Willy round
They can last all night
Hey down, stay down, stay down down
Cause little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
{Hook}
Up town, down town Little Willy, Willy drives them
Wild with his run-around style
Inside, outside, Willy sends them silly with
His star-shine shimmy shuffle smile
Mama done chase Willy down through the hall
But laugh, Willy laugh
He don't care at all
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down
Cause little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
{Hook}
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't
Willy won't, Willy won't
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy round
Willy won't go
Try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
But you can't push Willy round
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no
Little Willy, Willy won't go home
