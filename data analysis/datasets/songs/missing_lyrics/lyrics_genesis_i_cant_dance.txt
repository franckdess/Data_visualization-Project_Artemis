Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around
Hot sun making me sweat
Gator's getting close, hasn't got me yet

I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

Blue jeans sitting on the beach
Her dog's talking to me but she's out of reach
Shes got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

'Cause I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on

Young punk spilling beer on my shoes
Fat guys talking to me trying to steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool

But I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling

Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
A perfect body with a perfect face â€” uh-huh

No, I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way I walk
No, I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

But I can walk
No I can't dance
No no no I can't dance
No I said I can't sing
But I can walk
