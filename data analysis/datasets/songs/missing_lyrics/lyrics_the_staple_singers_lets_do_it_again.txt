Do it again, do it (Do it)
Let's do it again (Do it)
Mmm (Do it again, do it again)
Gonna do it again (Do it)
Do it, do it
Let's do it again (Do it)
Do it again
Sometimes the rain
Groovin' when I hear the sound
Like you and me, baby
Gettin' down with the sounds around
Oh, the smell of the mornin' flower
As we pass away the hour
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it (Do it)
Let's do it in the mornin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
Feeling your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Sweet love in the midnight
Good sleep, come mornin' light
No worries 'bout nothin'
Just gettin' good, just gettin' good
Just gettin' good love
Do it, do it again
Do it again (Do it)
Do it
Now I like you, lady
So fine with your pretty hair
If you don't mind my compliments
Just diggin' on the clothes you wear
I'm just a man now don't you fear
I can love you now I brought you here
I wanna do it again
(Do it) (Do it, do it) I wanna do it again
Ooh, oh, ho, hey, do it again
Do it
(Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Do it
Like a hammer on a clock
Love began to rock
Give the sister love and pride
Feel good and satisfied
I'm not a girl that you linger
But I feel like a Butterfinger
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it, do it
Let's do it in the mornin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
Feeling your sweet face
All laid up next to mine
Sweet love in the midnight
Good sleep, come mornin' light
No worries 'bout nothin'
Just gettin' good, just gettin' good
Just gettin' good love
Oh, hey, do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again
Do it (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it again
Do it again (Woo, hoo, hoo), do it again
Do it again, do it again, do it again (Woo, hoo, hoo)
Mmm...
(Woo, hoo, hoo)
Oh, hey
(Woo, hoo, hoo)
Do it again, do it again
