Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play the game, of fantasy
I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
: To make me feel better
: So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone, I'm well aware
Nothing can take your place of being there

So let me get the real thing
So let me get the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
