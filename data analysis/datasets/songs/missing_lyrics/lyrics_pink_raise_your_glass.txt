Right, right, turn off the lights
We're gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 A.M. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass

Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out (Freak out already)
Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now (It's so fuckin' on right now)

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you're gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass

Oh shit! My glass is empty
That sucks!
So if you're too school for cool (I mean)
And you're treated like a fool (Treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
So raise your (Ah, fuck)

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass for me
Just come on and come on and raise your glass
For me
