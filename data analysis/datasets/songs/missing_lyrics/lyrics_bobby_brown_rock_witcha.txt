Now that you are here with me
Baby, let's do it right
Lady, you know just what I need
I want to hold you, oh, so tight
Baby, just touch me anywhere
Cutie, you turn me on, ooh, baby
I'd like to run my fingers through your hair
So come on and stay with me all night
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
Feelings so strong
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet love, don't you ever stop
No, sweet baby
No
I want a little music now
Let's hear some Marvin Gaye, ooh
Ooh, let me rub your shoulders down
Let's dance the night away
Feel your heart beating next to mine
Baby, I'll make you feel nice
I think I can tell what's on your mind
I know I can make it right
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
Girl, all night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
The feeling's so strong, hey, girl
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet love, don't you ever stop
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
The feeling's so strong
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet love and don't ever stop
Oh...baby
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
Ooh...girl, all night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
Feeling's so, feeling's so strong, hey, girl
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet love and don't ever stop
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long, I wanna give it to you, girl
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
Oh, the feeling's so, feeling's so strong, baby
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
