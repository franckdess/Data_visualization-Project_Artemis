Dyin' flame, you're free again
Who could love and do that to you?
All dressed in black, he won't be comin' back
Well save your tears, you got years and years
The pains of seventeen's
Unreal they're only dreams
Save your cryin' for the day
Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the mornin' sun
Fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
Miss teenage dream, such a tragic scene
He knocked your crown and ran away
First wound of pride and how you cried and cried
Well save your tears, you got years and years
Fool if you think it's over
Fool if you think it's over
I'll buy you first good wine
We'll have a real good time
And save your cryin' for the day
Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the mornin' sun
Fool if you think it's over
It's just begun
New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the mornin' sun
Fool if you think it's over
It's just begun yeah
Fool if you think it's over
Fool if you think it's over
