(Verse 1: Lil Wayne)
I tell her "Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga."
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hairnet

Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap

I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

(Hook: Drake)
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
Told me "Baby it's real."
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal

'Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

(Verse 2: Lil Wayne)
And I tell her "Go on! Pop that pussy for me."
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I" give the rest of the vowels back

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her till she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen

Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
Told me "Baby it's real."
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal

'Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
