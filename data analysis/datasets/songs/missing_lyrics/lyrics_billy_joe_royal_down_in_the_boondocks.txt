Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her and she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks

Every night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill
I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will
But I don't dare knock on her door 'cause her daddy is my boss man
So I'll just have to be content and see her whenever I can

Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her and she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks

One fine day, I'll find a way to move from this old shack
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never, never will look back
Until that morning I'll work and slave and I'll save every dime
But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time

Down in the boondocks
Down in the boondocks
People put me down cause that's the side of town I was born in
I love her and she loves me but I don't fit in her society
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks
Lord, have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks
