Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
And everything will be alright, I
I promise these things to you
Girl just believe
I promise

Should of known the things you said been right
Forever is such a very long time
We never even had a fight
Don't let no one change your mind
Cause they don't know how much I care
They don't know the things we share unless they're here babe
But since they're not
How can they say that I'm not true, oh, oh, oh

If you need a love, I got the love that you need
Ain't no way they can take that from me
And I pray to God that one day they will see
They'll see that I'm all that you need

Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
And everything will be alright, I
I promise these things to you
Girl just believe

That I will see you another day
Baby nothing's gonna change, yes it is
Said you mean the world to me
And baby girl I keep you first, yeah
Cause that's the kind of love you deserve
And you know I got a love if you need a love, yeah
