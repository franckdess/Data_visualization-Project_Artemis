When he opens the door says "I'm home"
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been
For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
There'll be times when he won't say a word
And you wonder if it's something you said
The gentle touch of your hand
Tell him you understand
For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out be there
Show him that someone cares
He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart
For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
For the love of him
Make it your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can
