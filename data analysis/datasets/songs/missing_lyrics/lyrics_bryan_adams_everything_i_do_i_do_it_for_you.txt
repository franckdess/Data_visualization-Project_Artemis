Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Look into your heart - you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

Look into your heart, babe
Yeah
Oh Yeah

Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you
I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you
Yeah, I'd die for you

You know it's true
Everything I do
Oh, I do it for you
Everything I do, darling
And we'll see it through
We will see it through
Oh yeah
Yeah!
Search your heart, search your soul
You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for
Oh yeah
I'll be there, yeah, oh
I'll walk the wire for you, yeah
I will die for you
Oh yeah
All the time
I'm going all the way, all they way, yeah
Take me by the hand
Ow!
