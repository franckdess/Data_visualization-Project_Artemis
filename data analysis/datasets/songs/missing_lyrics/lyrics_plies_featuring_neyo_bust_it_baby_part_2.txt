Let me bring you in my world (Plies, Ne-Yo!)
And let you know what I call my lil' bust it baby

If I wahn't married to the streets, it'd be you
Yo' lips, what make you so cute
Love when you poke yo' mouth out when you mad, too
Save your number in my phone under "Lil' Boo"
Like your sex, but more in love of whatcha do
Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, I don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan 'round you, so all I can say is "ooh"
My favorite pannies of yours, the ones that see-thru
One wit the pink trim on 'em and they light blue
Speakin for the goons, thank God for makin you
BUST IT BA-BY is what I call you

She got me speedin in the fast lane, pedal to the floor mayne
Tryna get back to her love..
Best believe she got that good thang, she my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us, you'll know that's my
(BUSSST, IIIIIIT....) My ba-bay!
Everybody know that my..

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so now
They say he's an entertainer - (slow down)
You're just one more - (he don't respect you)
He just gon' hurt you - (and neglect you)
Well let 'em say what they wanna (yeah)
I made a promise (yeah) to do you right and I'm gonna (hey)
Girl I'll do everything I can, prove I'm a better man
Than your friends think I am, ohh...

She got me speedin in the fast lane, pedal to the floor mayne
Tryna get back to her love..
Best believe she got that good thang, she my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us, you'll know that's my

I jus' gave her a nick name, it's "Wet-Wet"
Cause when we finished, she mess up all the bedsets
She got sumthin to relax me when I'm under stress
Never told her or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you'da told me it was this good, I'da never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BA-BY, I keep her on deck

She got me speedin in the fast lane, pedal to the floor mayne
Tryna get back to her love..
Best believe she got that good thang, she my little hood thang
Ask around, they know us, you'll know that's my
(BUSSST, IIIIIIT....) My ba-bay!
Everybody know that my..
(BUSSST, IIIIIIT....) My ba-bay!
Everybody know that's my..
