Aiyyo Swizzy
I told these niggas I was coming back to bust they ass!
Okay! Remix! Part two!

See, now you know who the God be
Back runnin' the city and you know who the squad be
Flipmode, bitch, look see ain't nothin' changed
Now I'm back with the remix with the Queens of the game (Turn it up!!)
When you see me in the spot, you niggas better respect it
Y'all already know where I rep, ain't no reason to check it
And I know that you ain't fuckin' with me, just for the record
So instead, I'mma let Mary J. Blige come and set it
(Now get low Mary)

Maybe you can guess who it is (Uh huh)
Mary J. Blige, I'm 'bout to handle my biz (Uh huh)
I'm on my grown woman, still I rep for the kids
In every hood, and all my peoples doin' a bid (Turn it up!!)
Now you know who's really the queen, deliver the mail
Seven hundred thirty thousand, first week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch, lookin' all pale
While I'm on a yacht, overseas, doin' my nails

(Get low Digga!)
Now he sittin' there lookin' stuck
He thinkin' cause he spent a little dough I'm 'gon fuck
If money ain't a thing, I'm sayin' let a bitch know
Type to empty an account, how far you willin' to go (Turn it up!!)
Now he hopin' on the jet, he ain't wastin' no time
Told me all expense paid anyplace I could find
Hit the islands in the winter, trickin' all on his dime
Ain't a shorty in the world pussy better than mine, they wanna

Bus, this is serious, man!
(Get low, Missy)
I'm jinglin' baby, go 'head mami
Don't I look charmin', put your lips up on me
Kiss it, touch it, good, yes I wish you would (Turn it up!!)
You like to see me when I dip, baby, dip
Don't it look like I got Beyonce's hips
Lookin' like I could be like Nia Long
Boy, you smokin' that Cheech and Chong

(Get low, Banks)
I know it feels like I been gone for a minute
But I'm back, chinchilla ice on with a fitted
Everybody talk money, everybody gone with it
With that bowl of bread smaller than the arm of a midget
(Turn it up!!)
And you know I'm doin' my thing, it's blue in the ring
If you had it like this, you probably do it the same
But you won't, cause you broke, all you do is complain
After the club, I'mma put a few in the range and let 'em

(Get low, Papoose)
Five boroughs of death, you don't understand
I got New York City in the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist and let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world with a New York Nemesis (Turn it up!!)
I got Staten Island on my pinky, Queens on my thumb, dude
The Bronx on my middle finger screamin' fuck you
Rock ice in Manhattan so there's the ring finger
You know I had to keep Brooklyn on the trigger finger

(Get low, X)
Swizz is the monster, X is the beast
Fuckin' with Bus, everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets, I'm tired of talkin to y'all niggas
I'm a stick a fork in y'all niggas (Turn it up!!)
When I hit 'em man, that truck come get 'em man
Fucked up how I did 'em man
Ain't no remorse for the corpse, truth is
Can't I.D. the body, nigga toothless

(Get low, Bust)
You see me, you love me, the streets declare me God of the hood
You niggas is watchin' and wishin' you could
Be claimin' the throne the way I got it, lock it mu'fuckers
What's good, you tryin' to stop it, I'm wishin' you would (Turn it up!!)
Cause then I'm glad to hit you with the fact that the God is immortal as spit
The way I be doin' historical shit
In case you and your niggas act like you ain't know when I'm informin' your click
I take your bitch while I'm performin' my shit
