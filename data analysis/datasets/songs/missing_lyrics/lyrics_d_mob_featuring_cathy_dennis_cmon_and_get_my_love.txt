C'mon And Get My Love
D-Mob Introducing Cathy Dennis
Written by D. Poku
C'mon & get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
Break it down
So many times I've been around you
And I know how much I like you
It's like a dream each time I see you
And there's this magic in the air
I feel so shy that I can't approach you
Even though you're just there
But I know that one day I'll get my way
And this is what I'll say
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
C'mon and get my love, c'mon and get my love it's for you
And in my dreams I am with you
And I dance with your silhouette
There are many times I've tried to squeeze you
In these dreams I won't forget
It seems so long we've been together
Since way back then
And only if you knew how much I loved you
You'd turn to me and say.....
Let's just say that our love is right
Would you kiss and hold me tight
Cos I want to hold you and squeeze you
And tell you that I love you
Each and every night
Let's just say that our love is strong
Would you know were you belong
Or would I have to show you and teach you
Hold you and please you to show you that you belong
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
If there's been a time that I needed you
Then the time is now
I want to see you every hour
When I think I always hear you say....
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
C'mon & get my love, c'mon & get my love it's for you
Repeat Rap.....
