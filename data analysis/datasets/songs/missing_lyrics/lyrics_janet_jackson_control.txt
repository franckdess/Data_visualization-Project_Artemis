This is a story about control
My control
Control of what I say
Control of what I do
And this time, I'm gonna do it my way (My way)
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready?
I am
'Cause it's all about control (Control)
And I've got lots of it

When I was 17, I did what people told me, uhh!
I did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago
I'm in

Control
Never gonna stop
Control
To get what I want
Control
I like to have a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love, I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive, I thought it would be easy
Now I know I got to take

Control
Now I got a lot
Control
To get what I want
Control
Never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown up

Jam, ooh-ooh
Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own, I'll call my own shots
Thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand, and lead you in this dance
Control
It's what I got, because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world, just wanna run my life
Ooh
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance, just take

Control
Now I've got a lot
Control
To get what I want
Control
I'm never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown up

Ooh
Free at last
Out here on my own
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, eee
Now control this, uhh
Control
That's right
Control
Career moves
Control
I do what's right for me
Control
And me wants to groove
Is that okay?
Yeah!
Ooh, control

I've got my own mind
Ooh baby
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control
And I love it
Hahaha, that's right
Control
Now I got a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up
I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't make me lose it
