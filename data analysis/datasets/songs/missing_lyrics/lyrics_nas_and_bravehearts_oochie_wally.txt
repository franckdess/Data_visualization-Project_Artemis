Yo we got chicks in the living room getting it on and
They ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
"O" is for oochie
Oh you ain't know how many O's in the bankroll
Sort of like the game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
But my name ain't Regis
Nas the one they call when they want their thing beat up
Honeys with bodies with Bravehearts, guns in the party
Waves, braids, and baldies, trademark's the army
Is that Horse? It must be, I heard he husky
Yeah, there go Jungle, eyes red looking for trouble
And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is?
The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz
We taking honeys to the crib tonight
Guarantee we gon' get up in they rib tonight
Check the new slang, it's changed, the Braveheart gang, man
When you see me pass then holler oochie bang bang

Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang

Yeah what up ma? Take a look, you hypnotized
On how my long dick stretch your insides
For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
Stroke both holes, pass it to Nas
Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
Or pass it to Horse, then that ass getting tossed
Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail
I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy that's how a nigga feel
Bust three times, throw her the peace sign, she sleep
Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks
Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
Me and my dog fucking them both they got us switching
Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm living
That's how I'm playing - I got these freak fucking hoes singing

Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang

Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
Grind from the side and fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, she screaming like she dying
Make her cum four times without even trying
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying
Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat
Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them titties hang, I'll have all the bitches saying

Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang

When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally
