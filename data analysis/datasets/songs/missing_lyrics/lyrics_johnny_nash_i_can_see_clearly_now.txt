I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's going to be a bright, bright sun shiny day
It's going to be a bright, bright sun shiny day
I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's going to to be a bright, bright sun shiny day
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's going to be a bright, bright sun shiny day
It's going to be a bright, bright sun shiny day
