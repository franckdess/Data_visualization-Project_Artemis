My eyes are open wide
By the way, I made it through the day
I watched the world outside
By the way, I'm leaving out today

Well I just saw Halley's comet, she waved
Said, "Why you always running in place?"
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

I'm not angry, I'm just saying...
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close, it's only for today

Well I just saw Halley's comet, she waved
Said, "Why you always running in place?"
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

I'm not angry, I'm just saying...
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Here's my chance
This is my chance

Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

I'm not angry, I'm just saying...
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
