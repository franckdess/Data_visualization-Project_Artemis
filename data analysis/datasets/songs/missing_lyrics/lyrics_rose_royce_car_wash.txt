Ooh, you might not ever get rich
But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch
There ain't no telling who you might meet
A movie star or maybe even an Indian chief
Working at the car wash
Working at the car wash, yeah
Come on and sing it with me, car wash
Sing it with the feeling now, car wash, yeah
Ooh, come summer, the work gets kind of hard
This ain't no place to be if you planned on being a star
Let me tell you, it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you're at the pool
At the car wash, woah
Talking about the car wash, yeah
Come on y'all and sing it for me
Car wash, wooh, car wash, yeah
(Work and work) Well those cars never seem to stop coming
(Work and work) Keep those waxin' machines humming
(Work and work) My fingers to the bone
(Work) Keep up, I can't wait till it's time to go home
Hey, get your car washed today
Fillup and you don't have to pay
Come on and give us a play
Car wash, right away
At the car wash
Talking about the car wash
Car wash, yeah
Come on y'all and sing it with me
Car wash
Sing it with feeling y'all
Car wash, yeah
Wowowoh
(Car wash) Those cars never seem to stop coming
What I say
Keep those rags and machines humming
(Car wash) Let me tell you it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you, act the fool
At the car wash
Talking about the car wash, yeah
Car wash, yeah
Talking about the car wash, yeah
