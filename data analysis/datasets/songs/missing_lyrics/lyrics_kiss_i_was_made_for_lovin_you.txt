Mmmm, yeah, ha
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Tonight I wanna give it all to you
In the darkness there's so much I want to do
And tonight I wanna lay it at your feet
'Cause, girl, I was made for you
And, girl, you were made for me

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Tonight I wanna see it in your eyes
Feel the magic, there's something that drives me wild
And tonight we're going to make it all come true
'Cause, girl, you were made for me
And, girl, I was made for you

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?
I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can give it all to you, baby
Can you give it all to me?

Oh, can't get enough, oh, oh
I can't get enough, oh, oh
I can't get enough
Yeah, ha


Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Oh, I was made
You were made
I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
