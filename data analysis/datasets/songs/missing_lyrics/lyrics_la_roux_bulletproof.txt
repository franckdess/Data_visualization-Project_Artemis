I've been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet!
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not goin' in!
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap!
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet!

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead!
Do, do, do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt
There're certain things that should be left unsaid!
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh baby, your time is runnin' out!
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud!
All you do is fill me up with doubt!

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!

This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be bulletproof

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby (this time, baby, I'll be bulletproof)
This time baby
This time baby
This time
This time baby (This time baby, I'll be bulletproof)
This time baby
This time baby
This time
