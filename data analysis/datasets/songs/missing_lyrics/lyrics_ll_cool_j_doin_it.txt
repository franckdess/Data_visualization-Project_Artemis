Mmmm yeah (mmmmm) check it out baby
Make it hot... then we drop it
(oooooooh!) Uh, yeah
(oooooooh!) Uptown, you know how we do it
Yeah you know
Make it hot

It's the first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin' love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft
I'ma call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
So whatcha sayin'? I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
Mmm... daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga, Mandingo in the sack
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin' about
But do you really think that you can work it out?
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel

Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot
To hit now, get down
Damn I love a dick down, you use a rubber?
Damn right
You are my lover
All night
The putty good to you? Word to momma
Mad tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
Word we ain't goin' out like that
All this time you've been telling that you was a Don
I tried to warn you, girl, you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
Mmm, baby wild, don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back
You talk a good one shorty now you're makin' me sweat
How a live nigga like it girl?
Nice and wet
We get it on To The Break of Dawn, damn you're large
How a big girl like it Daddy?
Nice and hard
Safe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' that affectionate
Chewin' it, oohin' it, all while we're doin' it

Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn

Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot
Schemin' on the ass since the first day
Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
Roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessy
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn
