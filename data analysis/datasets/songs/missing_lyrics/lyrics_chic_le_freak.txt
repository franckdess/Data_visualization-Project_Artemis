Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out
Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out

Have you heard about the new dance craze
Listen to us, I'm sure you'll be amazed
Big fun to be had by everyone
It's up to you, it surely can be done
Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try, and you too will be sold
It's called Le Freak, they're doing it night and day
Allow us, we'll show you the way

Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out
Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of “Stompin' at the Savoy”
Now we freak, oh what a joy
Just come on down, to the 54
And find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out

Now freak
I said freak
Now freak

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the ride
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of “Stompin' at the Savoy”
Now we freak, oh what a joy
Just come on down, to the 54
And find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out
Ah, freak out
Le freak, c'est chic
Freak out
