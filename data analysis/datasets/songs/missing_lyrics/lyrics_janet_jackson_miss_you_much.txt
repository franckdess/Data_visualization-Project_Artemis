Shot like an arrow going through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby

I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much

I'm rushing home
Just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see
Your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes f-feel so g-g-g good
So I'll tell you baby

I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much

Miss you much
I miss you much
I really really miss you much
Miss you much
I miss you much
I'm not ashamed to tell the world
I miss you

I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
Baby, I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much

That's the end?
