The way that you love me
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
Way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

It ain't the clothes that you wear
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill
It ain't the plane that you fly
It ain't your black limousine
It ain't your ninety-foot yacht
It ain't the things that you'll get
It ain't the things that you got

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with your material things

It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby

It ain't your friends at the top
It ain't their fortune and fame
It ain't your heavy connections
It ain't the Hollywood game

Ain't famous people or the parties they throw
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the people you know

It's just the way that you love me
In the heat of the night
It's just the way that you love me, baby
It's just the way that you love me
When you love me right
It's just the way that you love me, baby
It's just the way that you love me
And the things that you do
It's just the way hat you love me, baby
It's just the way that you love me
Make me crazy for you
It's just the way that you love me, baby

Break it down, huh
That's right
Keep it
Right there
Ow!
Right there
Guitar

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with those material things

It ain't the trips to Brazil
It ain't the weekends in Rome
Baby, it ain't the French Riviera
You know I'd rather stay home

Ain't the Bahamas
It ain't Monaco
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the places we go

It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It ain't the money
It's just the way that you love me
Or the diamond rings
The way that you love me
Ain't you're buying me
It's just the way that you love me
The material things
The way that you love me
It ain't your Maserati
It's just the way that you love me
Your house on the hill
The way that you love me
It ain't the parties
It's just the way that you love me
Or the trips to Brazil

Watch me dancin'
Watch me dancin'
Watch me dancin'
I'm watching you, girl
Go
Watch me dancin'
Keep a-rocking the world
Go, go
Watch me dancin'
Go Paula
Watch me dancin'
Watch me dancin'
I'm watching you, girl
Watch me dancin'
