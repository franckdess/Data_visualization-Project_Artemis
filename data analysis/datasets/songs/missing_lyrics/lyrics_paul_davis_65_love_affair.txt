'65 love affair
Paul Davis
I was a car hop
You were into be-bop
You sang do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
All of them changes you put me through
If I could go back again
Well I know I'd never let you go
Back with some of my friends
To that wonderful
Chorus:
'65 Love Affair, We wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care It was a crazy
'65 Love Affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby
Well I acted like a dumb-dumb
You were bad with your pom-poms
You said ooh wah go team ooh wah go
Ooh-ee baby I want you to know
If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful
'65 Love Affair
When rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby
Well, I tried to make you give in
One night at the drive-in
You said oh no baby, oh no woo
All of them changes you put me through
If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful
Chorus
We sang doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
Doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo (repeat 5 times)
