(They smilin' in your face)
All the time, they want to take your place
The back stabbers (Back stabbers)
(They smilin' in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (Back stabbers)

All you fellas who have someone and you really care, yeah, yeah
Then it's all of you fellas who better beware, yeah, yeah
Somebody's out to get your lady
A few of your buddies, they sure look shady
Blades are long, clenched tight in their fist
Aimin' straight at your back
And I don't think they'll miss

(What they do?)
(They smilin' in your face)
All the time, they want to take your place
The back stabbers (Back stabbers)

I keep gettin' all these visits from my friends
Yeah, what they doin' to me?
They come to my house again and again and again and again, yeah
So are they there to see my woman?
I don't even be home, but they just keep on comin'
What can I do to get on the right track?
I wish they'd take some of these knives out my back

(What they do?)
(They smilin' in your face)
All the time, they want to take your place
The back stabbers (Back stabbers)

Ha-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Low-down, dirty

(What they do?)
(They smilin' in your face)
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes tell lies (Back stabbers)
(They smilin' in your face)
I don't need low-down, dirty bastards (Back stabbers)
(They smilin' in your face)
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Back stabbers)
Might be your neighbor (They smilin' in your face)
Your next door neighbor, yeah (Back stabbers)
