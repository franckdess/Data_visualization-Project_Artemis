Time

One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?

Twenty to seven
I will make you feel like heaven
I turn you upside down
I spin you round and round
I put a spell on you baby
I will make you come and play me
I'm gonna make you mine
Let's do it one more time

You spin me round and round and turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and hit me to the feeling

One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?

Play me (do it)
Play me baby
Play me (do it)
Show me what you got
Come play me (do it)
Play me baby
Play me
Don't stop don't stop

Do it, just do it, let's do it again and again
Keep it going on, show no shame
Come and play the game
How did I know that I would do this to you?
Now that I've made you mine
Let's do it one more time

You spin me round and round and turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and hit me to the feeling

One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?

Play me (do it)
Play me baby
Play me (do it)
Show me what you got
Come play me (do it)
Play me baby
Play me
Don't stop don't stop

You spin me round and round and turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and hit me to the feeling

One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?

Play me (do it)
Play me baby
Play me (do it)
Show me what you got
Come play me (do it)
Play me baby
Play me
Don't stop don't stop

Play me (do it)
