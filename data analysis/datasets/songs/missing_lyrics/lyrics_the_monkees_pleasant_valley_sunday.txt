The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care

See Mrs. Gray she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand

Creature comfort goals
They only numb my soul
And make it hard for me to see
My thoughts all seem to stray
To places far away
I need a change of scenery

Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta
Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta (Ahh)
Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta
Ta ta-ta ta, ta ta-ta ta (Ahh)

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Sunday)
Charcoal burninâ€™ everywhere
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday (Ah, Pleasant Valley Sunday)
