Doctor, my woman is comin' back home late today
Could ya' maybe give me something?
'cause the feelin' is gone and I must get it back right away
Before she sees that I've been
Up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
All around.... tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in
And I've looked high, low, everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feeling again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
Where did it run to?
I thought I'd done all that I could
Just to keep the lovelight burnin'
But whatever I've done I guess I just haven't done it too good
'cause all that's left is yearnin'
Cause I been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
All around....tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver, made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in
And I've looked high, and low and everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feeling again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
And I've been lookin', I've been lookin', I've been lookin'
I've been up, and down and tryin' to get the feelin'
I've been up ..I've been down...I've been tryin' to get
I've been tryin'..I've been tryin'..I've been tryin'
To get the feeling
I've been tryin' to get the feeling again
I want to get that feeling
I'm going to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling
And again...and again...and again...and again
Tryin' to get that feeling
I been tryin' to get the feeling again
