Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinking and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drown it out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinking and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

Okay back when I was sleeping in my mamaâ€™s crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song "Dreams" for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, "give me 20 dolla, dolla"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found her man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...
