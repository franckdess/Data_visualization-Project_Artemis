I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
Because he's not here with me
Hey window pane do you remember?
How sweet it used to be
When we were together
Everything was so grand, yes it was
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand...
I can't stand the rain
Alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay, yeah
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like a window you ain't got nothin' to say
I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window, no, no
'Cause he's not here with me
Alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay, yeah
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like a window you ain't got nothin' to say
(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
Against my window, no
(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
Against my window, against my window
(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
