Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be, that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(A little more time) I'm sure we do
(Yes he did, baby)

In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
It's deep inside, and leaves me purified

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(On you, yes he did, baby) Yes he did

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be, that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
God must have spent a little more time on you
(On you, you)
On you
(A little more time)
You, you
