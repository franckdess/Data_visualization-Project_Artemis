You

I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would

(And baby it's you)
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name and smile (Baby, you)
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night (Baby, you)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours, from this day forth

Next year lets call this day our anniversary
The day I put my heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on say that you'll always be mine
Cause girl when I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mind

(And baby it's you)
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name and smile (Baby, you)
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night (Baby, you)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours, from this day forth

I just wanna be yours from this day forth

The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name and smile
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours, from this day forth
