The moon up above
It shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre

A strawberry mind
Abody that's built for two
A kiss on the spine
We do things we never do
Come swallow the pride and joy of the ivory tower
We'll dance on the roof
Make love on a bed of flowers

That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre

The moon up above
It shines down upon our skin
(It shines down... on... our... skin)
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
(Whispering words that scream of... scream of sin)
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
(We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest... wildest dreams, yeah)
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
