{Intro}

Want some whiskey in your water?
Sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions you're askin' me?
This is the craziest party that could ever be
Don't turn on the lights cause I don't wanna see

Mama told me not to come, Oh Lord
Mama told me not to come
"That ain't the way to have fun, no" (Uh-uh!)
{Hook}

Open up your window, let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin' from the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scare me half to death
Open up the window, sucker, let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come, She say, uh
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son" she said
{Bridge}

The radio is blastin', someone's knockin' on the door
I'm lookin' at my girlfriend, she's passed out on the floor
I seen so many things I ain't never seen before
I don't know what it is, I don't wanna see no more

Mama told me not to come, Oh, Lord
Mama told me not to come
She said, "That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"

Mama told me, mama told me
Mama told me, told me, told me
Mama told me, told me, ooh, yeah, yeah
Mama told me not to go
Mama told me, mama told me
Ain't that the truth
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
{Outro}
