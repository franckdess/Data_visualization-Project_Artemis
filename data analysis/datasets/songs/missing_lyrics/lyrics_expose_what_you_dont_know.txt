No
Is not an answer
On and on I try to understand you see
Love
Is only letters
Until you prove your love is here inside for me
Can you feel it 
Or can't you see 
I'll never hurt someone as much I know
When you see me 
It's what you'll get 
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel

Don't know, don't know
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
Don't know
What you don't know might hurt you, ooo ooo ooo
You 
You play with fire
I know one day you're gonna be the one to burn
Love 
Is like a game haaa
What goes around comes around you wait your turn
It's a feelin' 
To change with time 
We'll always be together wait and see
If you know me 
That's what you'll get 
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel

Don't know, don't know
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
What you don't know
Don't know
What you don't know
Might hurt you
Don't know
Don't know
Don't know oh ho oh
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
Don't know
What you don't know might hurt you
(Music break)
