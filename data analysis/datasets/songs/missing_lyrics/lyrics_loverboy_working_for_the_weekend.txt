Everyone's watching to see what you will do
Everyone's looking at you, oh
Everyone's wondering will you come out tonight
Everyone's trying to get it right
Get it right

Everybody's working for the weekend
Everybody wants a little romance
Everybody's going off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance
Oh

You want a piece of my heart
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show
Come on, baby, let's go

Everyone's looking to see if it was you
Everyone wants you to come through
Everyone's hoping it'll all work out
Everyone's waiting, they're holding out

Everybody's working for the weekend
Everybody wants a little romance
Everybody's going off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance
Oh

You want a piece of my heart
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show
Come on, baby, let's go
You want a piece of my heart
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show
Come on, baby, let's go
You want a piece of my heart
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show
Come on, baby, let's go
