Clap for the Wolfman, he gonna rate your record high
Clap for the Wolfman, you gonna dig him till the day you die
Clap for the Wolfman, he gonna rate your record high
(Mmm... Yes, gracious!)
Clap for the Wolfman, you gonna dig him till the day you die

Doo-Ron-Ron and the Duke of Earl - they were friends of mine
I was on my moonlight drive
Snuggled in - say, baby, just one kiss - she said no, no, no
Romance ain't keeping me alive
Said, hey, baby, d'you wanna coo-coo-coo? - she said uh, uh, uh
So, I was left out in the cold
I said, you're what I've been dreaming of - she said I don't want to know
(Oh, you know - she was diggin' the cat on the radio)

Clap for the Wolfman - he gonna rate your record high
(Yes, baby, I'm your doctor of love)
Clap for the Wolfman - you gonna dig him till the day you die
(Everybody talks about the Wolfman's Pompitous of Love)

Seventy-five or eighty miles an hour she hollered, slow, slow, slow
Baby, I can stop right on a dime
I said, hey, baby, give me just one kiss - she said no, no, no
But, how was I to bide my time?
Said, hey, baby, d'you wanna coo-coo-coo? - she said uh, uh, uh
I said, I'm about to overload
I said, you're what I've been living for - she said I don't want to know
(You thought she was diggin' you, but she was diggin me!)

Clap for the Wolfman - he gonna rate your record high
(As long as you got the curves, baby, I got the angles)
Clap for the Wolfman - you gonna dig him till the day you die
(It's all according to how your boogaloo situation stands, you understand)
Clap for the Wolfman - he gonna rate your record high
(You ain't gonna get 'em, cause I got 'em)
Clap for the Wolfman - you gonna dig him till the day you die
(You might want to try, but I'm gonna keep em!)
(Ain't that right, girls?)
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman (and I got them all)
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
