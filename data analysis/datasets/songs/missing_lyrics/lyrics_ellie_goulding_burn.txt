We
We don't have to worry about nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave
No, we just gonna be right now, right now
And what we see is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco till the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, then we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
And there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn
