(Uno, dos, tres)

It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime but it's time for me to quit her

La la la, whatever
La la la, it doesn't matter
La la la, oh well
La la la

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood Sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight

I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis
Huh

La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter, la la la, oh well, la la la

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood Sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight

You got me singing, like
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, it doesn't matter, woahohoh, everybody now, ohohoh

Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out

Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out

It's you and me and were runnin' this town
And it's me and you and were shakin' the ground
And ain't nobody gonna tell us to go cause this is our show

Everybody
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, all you animals
Woahohoh, let me hear you now, ohohoh

Tonight, tonight there's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood Sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
Yeah it's all right, all right, tonight, tonight

Just singing like
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, all you party people
Woahohoh, all you singletons, ohohoh, even the white kids

Just don't stop lets keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, lets drop the beat down
It's my party dance if I want to
We can get crazy let it all out

Just don't stop let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party dance if I want to
We can get crazy let it all out
It's...
