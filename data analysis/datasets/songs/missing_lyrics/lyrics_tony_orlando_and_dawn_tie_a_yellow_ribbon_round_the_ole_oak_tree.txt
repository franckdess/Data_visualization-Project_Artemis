I'm coming home
I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you
I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If you still want me

Whoa
Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me (still want me)
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

Bus driver
Please look for me
Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison
And my love
She holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please



Now the whole damned bus is cheering
And I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole oak tree
I'm coming home, mmm, mmm
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
