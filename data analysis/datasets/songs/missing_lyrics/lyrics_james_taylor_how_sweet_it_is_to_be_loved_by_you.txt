How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms
There you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
There you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby, yes I do
How sweet it is to be loved by you, feels so fine
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby, whoa yes
How sweet it is to be loved by you (it's just like sugar sometimes)
How sweet it is to be loved by you, whoa yeah
You were better to me than I was to myself
For me there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby, oh yes
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Oh now, how sweet it is to be loved by you
It's like jelly baby, oh now
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Just like honey to the bee, baby, yeah now
How sweet it is to be loved by you
