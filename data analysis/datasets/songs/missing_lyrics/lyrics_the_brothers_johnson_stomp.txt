Steppin' out, the weekend's open wide
Fill it up, let's blast the jams and ride
While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Everybody take it to the top
We're gonna stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp, all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light
Mmm, runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall
So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Everybody take it to the top
We're gonna stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp, all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light
Gonna stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp, all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light
Stomp!

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp, all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light (Well, well, well)
Gonna stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light
Gonna stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light
Stomp!

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit (Take it to the top)
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it (Take it to the top)
Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it
Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it
