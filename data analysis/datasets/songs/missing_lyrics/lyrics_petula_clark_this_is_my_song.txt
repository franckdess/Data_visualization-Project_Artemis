Why is my heart so light
Why are the stars so bright
Why is the sky so blue
Since the hour I met you
Flowers are smiling bright
Smiling for our delight
Smiling so tenderly
For the world, you and me
I know why the world is smiling
Smiling so tenderly
Its just the same old story
Thru all eternity
Love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
The world cannot be wrong
If in this world there's you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So Love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
