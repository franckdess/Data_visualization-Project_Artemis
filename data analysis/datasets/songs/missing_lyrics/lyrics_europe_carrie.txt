When lights go down
I see no reason
For you to cry
We've been through this before
In every time
In every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie
Things they change, my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere again

I read your mind
With no intentions
Of being unkind
I wish I could explain
It all takes time
A whole lot of patience
If it's a crime
How come I feel no pain?

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye (Oh, oh, oh)

Carrie, Carrie
Oh, things they change, my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again


Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye, oh (Oh, oh, oh)

Carrie, Carrie
Oh, things they change
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie
Carrie, Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Oh, somewhere again

When lights go down
