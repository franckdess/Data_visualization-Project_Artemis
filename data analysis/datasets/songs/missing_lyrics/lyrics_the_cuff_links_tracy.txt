Tracy, when I'm with you
Something you do
Bounces me off the ceiling
Tracy, day after day
When you're this way
I get a lovin' feeling
Come with me
Don't say no (please don't say no)
Hold me close (and hold me close)
Tracy never let go
Tracy, your gonna be (Tracy, I love you so)
Happy with me
I'll build a world around you
Filled with love everywhere (Tracy, oh please don't go)
And when you're there
You'll be so glad I found you
Come with me
Don't say no (please don't say no)
Hold me close (and hold me close)
Tracy, never, never, ever let me go
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Come with me
Don't say no (please don't say no)
Hold me close
Tracy, never, never, ever let me go
Tracy, never let me go
Tracy, never let me go
Tracy, never let me go
