She must belong to San Francisco
She must have lost her way
Postin' a poster of Pancho and Cisco
One California day
She said she believes in Robin Hood and brotherhood
And colors of green and grey
And all you can do is laugh at her
Doesn't anybody know how to pray?
Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world
My myyy
Arizona, cut off your Indian braids
Arizona, hey won'tcha go my way
Mmmm, strip off your pride, you're acting like a teeny-bopper runaway child
And scrape off the paint from the face of a little town saint
Arizona, take off your hobo shoes
Arizona, hey, won'tcha go my way?
Follow me up to San Francisco
I will be guide your way
I'll be the Count of Monte Cristo
You'll be the Countess May
And you can believe in Robin Hood and brotherhood and rolling the ball in the hay
And I will be reading you an Aesop's fable
Anything to make you stay-ay-ay
Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
Arizona, have another look at the world, my my
Arizona, cut off your Indian braids
Arizona, hey, won'tcha go my way?
Hey, Arizona, take off your hobo shoes
Arizona, have another look at the world, my my
Arizona, get off your 8-ball blues
Arizona, hey, won'tcha go my way?
Come on, hey, Arizona, take off your rainbow shades
