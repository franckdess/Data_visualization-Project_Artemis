I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you
I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you
I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin', I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together, it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burning so come on, heed my desire
Come on, come on!

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you! I need you!
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts (Two hearts)
Come on! Come on!

People get jealous 'cause we always stay together
Yeah, baby
I guess they really want a love like yours and mine
Together, forever
I never thought that I could ever be this happy
Yeah, baby
My prayers were answered, boy, you came in the nick of time
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I got this feeling that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was falling apart
But now, at last, I really know that we are

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you! I need you!
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts (Two hearts)
Come on! Come on!

I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you
I-I-I-I-I need
I-I-I-I-I-I need
I need, I need, I need you

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
