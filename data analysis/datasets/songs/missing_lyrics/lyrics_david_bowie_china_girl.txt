Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

I could escape this feeling with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China Girl?
I hear hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says... shh
She says...

And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby, just you shut your mouth
She says... shh
She says...

Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
