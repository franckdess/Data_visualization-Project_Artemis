Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet
It's the rhythm of the island
Like the sugar cane so sweet
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away
'Cause tonight we're gonna party
'Til we see the break of day
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
