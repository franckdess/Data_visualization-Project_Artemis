I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
I know why you dialed my number
I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
I know why you care
I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
I know why you say you love me
I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
And I don't think it's fair
I know why you dialed my number
I know why you say you're mine
I know what you're doing
And it's not gonna work this time
Not gonna work this time
I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
I can never sing in that key
I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
And you're the one to blame
I know what you're doing, yeah, yeah
I know why you can't forgive me
I know why you're singing lost love
The lyrics haven't changed
I can recognize the symptoms
You should know I've changed my mind
I know what you're doing
And it's not gonna work this time
Hey, said it's not gonna work this time
Not gonna work this time
Not gonna work this time
I know what you're doing, baby
I know why you call my name
I know why you say you love me
But I can't say the same
I can recognize the symptoms
You should know I've changed my mind
I know what you're doing
And it's not gonna work this time
