Hello, it's me again
Don't you know
It's hard to keep a good woman down?
But then again
Maybe that could be fun
Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox!

Ain't it funny how
When I say let's go out
You're always saying
Someone else will get me
What's a girl to do?
I like to have fun too
But you're so jealous
You never let me
So how come you can leave
But when it comes to me
Always something I must prove
You know I love you
Always thinking of you
But tonight
I've got to make that move

I wanna have some fun
Move my body all night long
I wanna have some fun
Move my body all night long

What your momma used to say
All work
No play
I know what to do
I think I'll call my crew
Of course
I love you
But naughty girls need fun too
Could it be
That I make you feel guilty why
Is there something I can't see
I just don't buy it
So don't even try it
I've got to go in the place to be

I wanna have some fun
Move my body all night long
Working hard every day
So I ain't staying home no way
I need it
I want it
Got to
Flaunt it
I'm not a prisoner
Can't you see?
Unlock the door so I can breathe
Whenever it comes to you, my dear
I say stay with me
But you still go
So now I learn
It's my turn
I want you to stay here with me
You can have fun with me
With you?
Yeah, with me!
Come on
I can have loads of fun without you
Without me?
Yeah!
