Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin' and slippin' & slidin'
It's magic

And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
(I'm taking a dive, dive)

Making believe this is what you conceived
From your worst day (I'm taking a dive)
Oh, moving in line then you look back in time
To the first day (I'm taking, I'm taking)

And you and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
(I'm taking a dive on the slide, hey)

Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream (I'm taking a dive)
Oh, so let her go, don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream (I'm taking, I'm taking)

And you and your sweet desire (Don't you do it, don't you do it)
You took me, oh, higher and higher, baby

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
