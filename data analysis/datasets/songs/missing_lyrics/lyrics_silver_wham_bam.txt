Starry nights, sunny days
I always thought that love should be that way
Then comes a time that you're ridden with doubt
You've loved all you can and now you're all loved out
Ooh ooh baby, we've been a long, long way
And who's to say where we'll be tomorrow?
Well, my heart says no, but my mind says it's so
That we got a love, is it a love to stay?

We got a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

Looking at you, I wanted to say
I think a little emotion goes a long, long way
Careful now, don't get caught in your dreams
Look out, baby, this is not what it seems
Ooh ooh baby, you've been so good to me
But please don't make it what it's not
Well, I thought we agreed on what we need
So listen to me, I'll tell you what we've got

We got a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

I think you're seein' what I've been sayin'
'Cause I hear you singin' to the tune I'm playin'
Now that it's said and we both understand
Let's say our goodbyes before it gets out of hand
Bye bye baby, I'd really like to stay
But we'll remember the best time in our life

We had a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
