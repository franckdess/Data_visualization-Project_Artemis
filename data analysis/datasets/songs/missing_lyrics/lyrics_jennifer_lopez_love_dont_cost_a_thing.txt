Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Ooh)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When I took a chance thought you'd understand (You don't understand)
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're trying to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you (You) that I really feel (Feel)
Doing way too much (Much), never keep it real (Real)
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? I've got to go

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (Baby)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (No)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make (That you make)
Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke (Even if you were broke)
My love don't cost a thing (My love don't cost a thing)
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I wanna, don't)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't (Think I wanna)
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
