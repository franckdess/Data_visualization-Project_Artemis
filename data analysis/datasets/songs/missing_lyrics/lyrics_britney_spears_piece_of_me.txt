Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazine
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra! This Just In'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin'
(You want a piece of me?)

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
Trying, and pissing me off
Well, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Slippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'
Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
You want a piece of me?
