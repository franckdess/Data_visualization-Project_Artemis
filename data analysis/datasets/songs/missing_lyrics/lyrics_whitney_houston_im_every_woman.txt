Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
It's all in me
Yeah

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa (oh) whoa (oh) whoa

I can cast a spell
See, but you can't tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear
Yeah oh

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

Oh, I can sense your needs
Like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, baby baby

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I ain't bragging
Because I'm the one
Just ask me
Oh, it shall be done
And don't bother
To compare
I've got it
