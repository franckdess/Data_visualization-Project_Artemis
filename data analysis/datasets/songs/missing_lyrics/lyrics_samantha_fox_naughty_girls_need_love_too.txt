Maybe
Just maybe
Naughty girls need love too

I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough
With hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same
Love
Was just a four letter word
Never heard
How absurd
How it could be
But now
I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me
Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was just something I had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused

Baby, don't let me be misunderstood
Temporary love's so bad
But it feels so good
Then along came you
Now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love too
Then came you
Then came you

Yes, it's true
I'm in love with you
And believe it, baby
This time your love won't get away
Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day
Ooh, it's only you I adore
So much more
Than my body was asking for
Yes
Your love is breaking my chill
Even still there's a thrill in my heart

Samantha Fox was such a wild dame
Huh
But what's in a name?
(S-S-Samantha, S-S-Samantha Fox)
No more fun and games of the mind
Let's get busy one time

So moving like you're forty
This groove is much too naughty
Can't you see
I want you just for me
Boys, make some noise

Girl, I want to shower you with diamonds
And please don't tease
If you lie my heart will freeze
Freeze, freeze, freeze
Don't let me, baby
Temporary love's so bad
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came you
Then along came you
Don't, don't
Don't, don't
Temporary, temporary
Temporary, temporary
Came along, came along
Came along, came along
Naughty girls need love
Baby, baby
Don't let me
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came you
