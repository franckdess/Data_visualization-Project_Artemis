I been chewed up and spit out and shit on and pissed on/
The gun it done dug in my hip bone my pops is the only one
Want me to live long from then on, I been on
A struggle to get on It's complicated/I'm one of the greatest Nominated even my momma say it I need it
It be keeping me concentrated believe it when you see it
I dominate it you see that I'm conceded now tolerated it
This hot sauce/
Yeah
Killin all y'alls ass droppin' jews( jewels) spittin' holocaust gas
(Ooh shit)
Look how I got 'em all mad
Hearts brittle like China doll glass
I get on 'em/ get my timing on em an assignment on 'em
Pimpin' I'm not talkin 'bout a class/ put a rope around his neck and tie it on 'em/ make it tighten on 'em/ hope a lightning bolt will hit his ass/
Evertime I rap I, get better, read the writing on the cast/ she told me that she wanted the karma, like whats that!?... come back here and bite me on the ass/
Oh
Everybody's bitch is tryin' to fuck/ wanna be my bed buddy lovey let 'em cuddle up/ tryin' to get some head from me got me stickin' out my tounge/ from the land of Ted Bundy I'm a stick and I'm a run/
Just to prove it I can do the shit better ahead of the rest of 'em metrophical entity/ with ability and/ adrenaline in me, the feeling of killing an enemy/ the pen is appealing, penicillin,  picture them sick of me/
Can't nobody get with me/ I'm just keeping it a century/  I ain't met a mothafucka yet that could spit with me/ I'm gonna blow soon as they get a sniff of me/
Take some Big and some Pac, some E40 and Tech/and mix 'em together now what the fuck do you get/ the realist and illest killer you done met/ I'm the juggernaut killer homie now show me respect
