Yo, yo yo move out of the way

(funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party)

Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lift a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud like Timmy
Uh had to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap get my head sucked right
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the right
You drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton

Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know I know, I don't even care about her beign preganant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do
We should go get her album when it comes out
There she go, there she go, there she
Heeeey Misssy

Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I ain't knowin yall broke Milli Vanilli
Jay Jay fan wannabes ain't over here gossiping bout me?
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents so your lights won't get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad cuz Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party
Yo by the way, go get my album
Damn!
