We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer day
Anticipation
Anticipation
Is making me wait
Is keeping me waiting
And I tell you how easy it is to be with you
And how right your arms feel around me
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be
Anticipation
Anticipation
Is making me wait
Is keeping me waiting
And tomorrow we might not be together
I'm no prophet
I don't know nature's way
So I'll try to see into your eyes right now
And stay right here
Cause these are the good old days
