Party-people!
Yeah, Tag Team music in full effect!
That's me - DC the Brain Supreme, and my man Steve Roll'n!
We're kickin' the flow! (We're kickin' the flow!)
And it goes a little something like this!

Tag Team, back again
Check it to wreck it, let's begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
DC's in the house, jump, jump, rejoice
Says there's a party over here, a party over there
Wave your hands in the air, shake the derriere
These three words mean you're gettin' busy:
Whoomp, there it is! Hit me!

Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!

Upside down and inside out
I'm 'bout to show all you folks what it's all about
Now it's time for a nigga to get on the mic
And make this motherfuckin' party hype
I'm takin' it back to the old school
'Cause I'm an old fool who's so cool
If you wanna get down, I'mma show you the way
Whoomp, there it is! Let me hear you say...

Whoomp, there it is! (come on y'all)
Whoomp, there it is! (a little louder)
Whoomp, there it is! (come on y'all)
Whoomp, there it is! (louder)
Whoomp, there it is! (come on y'all)
Whoomp, there it is! (a little louder)
Whoomp, there it is! (come on y'all)
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp! Shaka-laka-shaka-laka shaka-laka shaka
Whoomp! Shaka-laka-shaka-laka shaka-laka shaka
Whoomp! Shaka-laka-shaka-laka shaka-laka shaka
Whoomp! Shaka-laka-shaka-laka shaka-laka shaka

Point blank - gin and juice I drink
And then invent as I puff on dank
Rock the mic, uh oh, I crave skin
Rip shit, find a honey dip to dip it in
Slam dunk it, stick it, flip it and ride
That B-double-O-T-Y, oh my
Ooh, that's it, come on, come on
Whoomp, there it is! I'm done

Whoomp, there it is! (come on)
Whoomp, there it is! (louder)
Whoomp, there it is! (give it to me)
Whoomp, there it is! (come on, come on)
Whoomp, there it is! (little louder)
Whoomp, there it is! (yeah!)
Whoomp, there it is! (come on, come on)
Whoomp, there it is! (yeah!)
Heyy! Babyy! Whoomp, there it is!
Heyy! Babyy! Whoomp, there it is!

Some say I'm crazy 'cause I'm pushing up dasies
The underground sound that you niggas have found
Amazing, outstanding, demanding
Commanding, you people dancing (whooooo!)
Shit! That's a breathtaker
Our producer a.k.a. the undertaker
You wanna come down to the underground old school?
Here's a shovel, can you dig it, fool?
Can you dig it? We can dig it!
Can y'all dig it? We can dig it!
Can you dig it? We can dig it!
Can y'all dig it? We can dig it!
Can you dig it? We can dig it!
Can y'all dig it? We can dig it!
Can you dig it? We can dig it!
Can y'all dig it? We can dig it!

W-H-double O-M-P as I flow
To the fly shit from the school of old
Hard core, keep' the folklore wrecked
3 to the 2 and 1, mic check
Mad skill, flow ill, on the mess of steel
That's the grille of the microphone I just killed
Party people, there's your party, Tag Team is through
Whoomp there it is, I thought you knew

Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!

Yeahh! Tag Team music comin' straight at 'cha!
That's me - DC the Brain Supreme, and my man Steve Roll'n!
Bring it back y'all, bring it back y'all, bring it back, here we go!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
Whoomp, there it is!
