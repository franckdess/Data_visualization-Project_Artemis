Don't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune, yeah
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
The sun will always, always shine
(And tomorrow, we might wake on the other side)

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh
Ooh, don't you bring me down
Ooh, today
