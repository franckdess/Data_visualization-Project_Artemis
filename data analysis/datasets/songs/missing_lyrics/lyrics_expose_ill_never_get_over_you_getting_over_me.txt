I hear you're taking the town again
Having a good time
With all your good time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now
And I'm alone and free
I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you could never be right
As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me
I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody
That I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away (won't go away)
Lonliness found me
Looks like it's here to stay
I know that I ought to find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinkin' of you
As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me
Oh... No matter what I do
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this. (I need your touch)
You're the only one I ever loved... oh
And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me
I'll never get over you gettin over
Never get over you... gettin over
I'll never get over you gettin' over me
