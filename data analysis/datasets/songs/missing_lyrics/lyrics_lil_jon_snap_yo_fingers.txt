Straight from the Bay, posted in the 'A'
Bout to hit the club, we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' on some Rossi, Jon on Patron
VIP status, strapped wit my chrome
Look around the club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' side to side to the beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to the groove
All by they self, that's the new move
Nigga, where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how it's done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said 'the Pool Palace'
Straight from Bankhead, I said 'you good at it'
Do what'cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, the more it's lookin' smooth
It's nuthin' to a boss, I can do the shit too

Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

Chillin' in the vip, yeah, we gettin' crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air
I'm throwin' up the E's to let 'em know we in here
Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out the ol' school 'cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my Glock BITCH!
Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from the Dec
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on the best, we don't fuck wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah I'm back to the track, back to the snap
1, 2 step, then you gotta lean back
This is how we do it in the A town
(And if you ain't know) This is how it goes down

Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Hey! Hey!
