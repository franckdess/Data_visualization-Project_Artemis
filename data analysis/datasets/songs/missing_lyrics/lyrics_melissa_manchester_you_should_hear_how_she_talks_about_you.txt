She's so very nice
You should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
What you trying to hide
When you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find
Ah, can't you see it
Don't you think she's feeling the same
Ah, I guarantee it
She's the one that's calling your name
Chorus:
You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she said
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head
You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love
I ain't telling tales
Anybody else could repeat the things that I've heard
She's been talking sweet and it's on the street
How our girlfriend's spreading the word
Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you know the story's for real
Repeat first half of the Chorus
You should hear how she talks about you
She is really in love
Ah, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ah, now don't you worry
If you're scared the love is for real
Repeat Chorus and then fade
