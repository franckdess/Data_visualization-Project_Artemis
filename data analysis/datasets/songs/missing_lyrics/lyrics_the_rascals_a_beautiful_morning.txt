It's a beautiful morning, ahh
I think I'll go outside a while and just smile
Just take in some clean fresh air, boy
Ain't no sense in staying inside
If the weather's fine and you got the time
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day
Either way, it's a beautiful morning, ahh
Each bird keeps singing his own song, so long
I've got to be on my way now
Ain't no fun just hanging around
I've got to cover ground, you couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines
When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide
Ahh, oh
(Shouldn't hide)
Ah, ah, oh
(Do, do, waa, do, do, waa)
There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour
Seems to me that the people keep seeing
More and more each day, gotta say, lead the way
It's okay, Wednesday, Thursday, it's okay
(Ahh)
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, weekday, ah, ah, ohh
(Do, do, waa)
Ah, ah, oh, oh
(Do, do, aah)
Woo, ooh, ooh, oh, oh
Oh, ah, wo, do, waa
Ohh, oh, oh, oh
