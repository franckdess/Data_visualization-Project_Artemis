My baby does the hanky panky

I saw her walkin' on down the line
You know I saw her for the very first time
A pretty little girl standin' all alone
Hey pretty baby, can I take you home?
I never saw her, never really saw her
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky


I saw her walkin' on down the line
You know I saw her for the very first time
A pretty little girl standin' all alone
"Hey pretty baby, can I take you home?"
I never saw her, never really saw her
