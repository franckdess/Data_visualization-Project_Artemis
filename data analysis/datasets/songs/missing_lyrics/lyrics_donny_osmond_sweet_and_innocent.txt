I love the little wiggle in your walk
The way you cuddle on my shoulder
But you're too young to know this, girl
So come back when you're older
Cause you're too sweet and innocent
But you're just
Oh, too young for me
The way you hold me not too tight
The tender way you kiss good night
Still say you've got some growing up to do
Whoa, oh, ho
Young and beautiful is a love
Oh, you give to me, yeah
You're not hip
So get with it, girl
Go on home to your make-believe world
Sweet and innocent
You're too young and beautiful for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sweet and innocent
But you're just
Oh, too young for me, yeah
I'd like to kiss you and hold you tight
So go on home, girl
Or I just might
You're too sweet and innocent
You're too young and beautiful for me
You're so sweet and innocent
But you're much too young, little girl
Go on home
Just leave me alone, little girl
