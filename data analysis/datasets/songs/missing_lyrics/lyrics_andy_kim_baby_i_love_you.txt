Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you?
It isn't easy to explain
And though I'm really trying
I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day
When you touch me, I just got to say
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Come on baby, na na na na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way
Oh, I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name
Tell me baby, that you feel the same
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Come on baby, na na na na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
Come on baby, na na na na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
Oh, my heart can't wait another day
When you touch me, I just got to say
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Come on baby, na na na na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
Baby, I love you
Baby, I just love you
Baby, I love you
