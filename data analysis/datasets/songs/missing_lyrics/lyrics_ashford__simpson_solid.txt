And for love's sake
Each mistake
Oh, you forgave
And soon both of us
Learned to trust
Not run away
It was no time to play
We build it up
And build it up
And build it up
And now it's solid
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
That's what we've got, oh, mmm
Solid
Solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it, woo
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Oh, ha, you didn't turn away
When the sky went gray
Somehow we managed
We had to stick together
You didn't bat an eye
When I made you cry
We knew down the line
We would make it better
And for love's sake
Each mistake
Oh, you forgave
And soon both of us
Learned to trust
Not run away
It was no time to play
We build it up
And build it up
And build it up
And now it's solid
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
That's what we've got, oh
Yes, it is
Solid
Solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Gone with the wind
Another friend
Got in between
Tried to separate us
Knock, knock on wood
You understood
Love was so new
We did what we had to
And with that feeling
We were willing
To take a chance
So, against all odds
We made a start
We got serious
This wouldn't turn to dust
We build it up
And build it up
And build it up
And now it's solid
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
Oh, that's what we've got, oh
Solid, yes it is
Solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Solid
Solid as a rock
You know it, well
You know it, baby
Solid
Solid as a rock
Solid
Don't leave me, baby
Solid as a rock
Solid
Solid as a rock
Solid
Solid as a rock
Good, good thing
Solid (solid, solid, solid, solid, solid)
As a rock
