Ether boy!!!! Hey!!!!
How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it

We need more bottles tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clique 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up

Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance

When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)

(*OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!!!)
Only Patron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standin on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way s**t
We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin at the light
How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it

Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you she lyin but she fake it
When she with me she like it she never fake it
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
