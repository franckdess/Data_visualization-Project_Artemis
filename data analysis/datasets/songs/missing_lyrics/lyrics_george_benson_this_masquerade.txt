​
Are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?
Looking for words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anywhere
We're lost in a masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try
To understand the reasons why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade

Wohoho, in a masquerade
