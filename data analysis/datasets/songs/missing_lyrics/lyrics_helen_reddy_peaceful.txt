I'll wake the sun up by givin' him a fresh air full of the wind cup
And I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow

Nobody breathing in my ear

And maybe some day he'll up and say "We had a pretty nice time", oh, oh, oh, my
'cause it's oh, so peaceful here
There's no one bending over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here
