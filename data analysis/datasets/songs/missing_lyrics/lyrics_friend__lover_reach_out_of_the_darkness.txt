I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
I knew a man that I did not care for
And then one day this man gave me a call
We sat and talked about things on our mind
And now this man, he is a friend of mine
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
Don't be afraid of love
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid to love
Listen to me
Everybody needs a little love
Everybody needs somebody
That they can be thinking of
Now, reach out!
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
And you may find a friend
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I think it's so wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together
