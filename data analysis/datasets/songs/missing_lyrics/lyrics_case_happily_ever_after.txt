Guess what I did today
Those were the words I said to you
It was last may, dont know the exact day
In my hand there was a ring
Then you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
So I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife

Yes I will
I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
Till my humble life is ended
And time begins again, couldn't we be...

Couldn't we be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long
My love is oh so strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be?
Leaving you never till forever's gone

When I was away, mmm, mmm
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart
And so many times
Pictured this day inside my mind
And for so many years, ooh
I knew it would be you here with me, oh

Yes I will
Take you for my wife
The center of my life
And I will never, ever fade
From this choice I made, oh

Couldn't we be happily ever after?
C'mon
We could be strong together for so long
Said my love is strong
Couldn't we be happily ever after?
Couldn't we be, babe?
Leaving you never till forever's gone
No no, Hey yeah

You don't have to look no further than me
Don't look no more, baby yeah
You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy
I'm so happy, I'm so happy babe
Beneath the sight of God, I will make this vow to you, come on baby
I'll be right here, stay with me
Said I'll be here, baby hey

Couldn't we be happily ever after
I said I wanna be, I said I wanna be
We could be strong together for so long
Couldn't we be happily ever after
Couldn't we be, babe?
Leaving you never till forever's gone
No, no I will never leave you, ooh
Couldn't we be happily ever after...
See today, I wanna make you my wife...
