Night is dragging her feet
I wait alone in the heat
I know, know that you'll have your way
'Til you have to go home
No's a word I can't say
Cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?
Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms, in the web of your lies
But it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?
Gets me nowhere to tell you no
It gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?
Gets me nowhere to tell you no
It gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?
Gets me nowhere to tell you no
It gets me nowhere to make you go
