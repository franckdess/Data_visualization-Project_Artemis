You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
Cause (I, I, I, I, I) I want you back

It's hard to say I'm sorry
It's hard to make the things I did undone
A lesson I've learned too well, for sure
So don't hang up the phone now
I'm trying to figure out just what to do
I'm going crazy without you

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

Baby I remember
The way you used to look at me and say
Promises never last forever
I told you not to worry
I said that everything would be all right
I didn't know then that you were right

You're all I ever wanted
(Baby, you're all)
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back

I want you back, oh
Yeah, eh, eh
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
Girl, what can I do?
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
Tell me, what can I do?

You're all I ever wanted
(You're the one I want)
You're all I ever needed
(You're the one I need)
So tell me what to do now
(Tell me, what can I do?)
When I want you back

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want you back
