All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never around to love me, you're always gone
Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you
You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep
Don't you tell yourself that it's okay
Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change
Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die
Black cat, black cat
Man, I don't understand your ways
Living on the edge

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die
Black cat, living' on the
Heartbeat, better watch your step
