Rick Ross (the Boss)
T-Pain (J-J-J-J-J.R)

I don't make love, baby we make magic
Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin'
Always wear a plastic, baby cause shit happens
She leaked the back seat, just to freak in the Magnum
Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets, strapped with them thangs
She in love with the G, so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Ten black Maybachs back to back in a lane
I'mma make it rain, and I'mma make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie, that's a fact
Workin' with the police, actin' like you know me
Fresh out of jail, already in yo' hoe cheeks

I got a fresh line-up, yeah, a fresh outfit
'Bout to have the parkin' lot on smash
Plus I got a Chevy wit a fo'-fifty-fo' in the hood
That bitch got 125 on the dash (She like it gangsta cause)
(I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far)
(I'm the, I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far, hey)
(I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far)
Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss
The boss, boss-boss-boss
Boss-boss-boss, boss-boss-boss
The boss, boss-boss-boss
Boss-boss-boss, boss-boob-boss
And shawty straight diggin' me, and I ain't even rich
I know you niggas on the sideline like, "Ain't that a bitch?"
I'm on my job, ey and I ain't gettin' off
Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss

I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far (Ross!)
Got the biggest cars, Spanish broads, no bra
Call that other lame for the walks in the parks
I ain't come to play games, I just wanna play my part
Tell ya girlfriend come talk with me, dog
We straight Gs' then we came here to ball
Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you'll count 'em all
Then we off to that Chevy, fired up and takin' off
Baby, slow it down cause you movin' too fast
Ass too fine to be movin' too fast, hol' up
Back to the thuggin', now I'm sippin' sizzurp
All my niggas love it, baby that's my wizzerd
Stack for the jeans, five bones for the shizzerts
I don't smoke twenties, eight hundred for the izzerds
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
You can tell by the strongs that's standin' by the car

I got a fresh line-up, yeah, a fresh outfit
'Bout to have the parkin' lot on smash
Plus I got a Chevy wit a fo'-fifty-fo' in the hood
That bitch got 125 on the dash (She like it gangsta cause)
(I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far)
(I'm the, I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far, hey)
(I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far)
Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss
