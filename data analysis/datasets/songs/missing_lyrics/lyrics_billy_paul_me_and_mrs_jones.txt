Me and Mrs Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We meet every day at the same cafe â€” 6:30
I know, I know she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs, Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

We gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high
Cause she's got her own obligations
And so, and so do I

Me and Mrs, Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong
To let it go now

Well, it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way
And I'll go mine
But tomorrow we'll meet the same place
The same time

Me and Mrs, Mrs. Jones
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on

We gotta be extra careful
We can't afford to build our hopes up too high
I wanna meet and talk to you
At the same place, the same cafe, the same time
And we're gonna hold hands like we used to
We gonna talk it over, talk it over
We know, they know
And you know and I know it was wrong
But I'm thinking strong
We gotta let 'em know now
That we got a thing going on, a thing going on
