D-Wizzle on the track,  D-Wizzle on the track
Baby Boy Da Prince 

This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Six months later now we’re big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin’ shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I’m one of the baddest
French Riviera spot and I’m getting in shape man
I think I’m Super M-a-n without a cape man
Ridin’ all day hustlin’, all for the cake man
I’m a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes
First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon
I’m growin’ up now spittin’ hotter than Mohellans
I’m a steal every girl ever gon’ to fly
I’m a young little dude, stay runnin’ from cops
And Marrero is the place where I got my props
People love me in da hood they don’t want me to stop
So uhh, that’s the only way I know how to rock
And I’m a stay rappers like won’t stop ‘til I drop

This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

I I’s Baby Boy and I done it again
I’m ridin fly with D-Wizzle in ‘cedes Benz
Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent
Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent
And they don’t question what I say cause I’m a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I is represent, my rail room for life
Money in my pocket but I still act trife
While I in da club they say the parlor a’int right
Look I’m-doing great that’s the way I feel
Hustlin’ hard all day that’s the way I live

This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live


This the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside
Red pepper paint must believe my ish ride
They pause like stop signs when they rollin’ up
Cause’ when the doors open up, they open UP
I’m Lamboin’ it I was stashed, off stage I’m throwin’ it
Cause they say I’m like Katrina with money, I blow the shhhh
Real been gravy, three years out of da eighties
Solos, shabo’s valley animals played it
Commodores mirages, not the Nike hirages
It cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this
Y’all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine
Don’t give me viesels y’all thinkin’ this McDonalds size
I been fly I I I I I I I I from the crib to the ri I I I I I de
Fifty-Four inch screens 26 inches from the ceiling dude
The plasma look like a projector up in da livin’ room homie!

This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live
Ho, this is the way I live, I live, I
