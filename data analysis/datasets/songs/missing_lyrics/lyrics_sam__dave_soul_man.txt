Comin' to you on a dust road
Good lovin', I got a truck load
And when you get it, you got something
So don't worry, cause I'm coming

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
That ain't all, look

That's what I got, the hard way
And I'll make it better each and every day
So honey, don't you fret, heh
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man (Play it Steve)
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

I was brought up on a side street, listen now
I learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated at Woodstock
When I start lovin', oh, I can't stop

I'm a soul man (I wanna tell you), yes I am
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man, yeah
I'm a soul man
Look

Well, grab the rope and I'll pull you in
Give you hope and be your only boyfriend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm talkin' about a soul man
I'm a soul man, (and you a) soul man
I'm a soul man, oh no, soul man
I'm a soul man, (and you a) soul man
And you're a soul man...
