We get up early and we work all day
We put our time in because we like to stay up

All night long

We keep on grinning until the weekend comes
Just a pinch between your cheek and gum


Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business and we have some fun


We like a long neck and a good old song
Turn it up and then we sing along, sing along
We're all staying up
