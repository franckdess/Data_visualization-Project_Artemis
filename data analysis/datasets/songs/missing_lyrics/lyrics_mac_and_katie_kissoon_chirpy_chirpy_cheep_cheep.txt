Where's your mama gone
Where's your mama gone
Little baby bird
Little baby bird
Where's your mama gone
Where's your mama gone
Far, far away
Far, far away...
Chorus:
Last night I heard my mama singing this song
Ooh wee chirpy chirpy cheep cheep
Woke up this morning and my mama was gone
Ooh wee chirpy chirpy cheep cheep
Chirpy chirpy cheep cheep chirp
Where's your mama gone
Where's your mama gone
Little baby bird
Little baby bird
Where's your mama gone
Where's your mama gone far, far away
Where's your papa gone
Where's your papa gone
Little baby bird
Little baby bird
Where's your papa gone
Where's your papa gone
Far, far away, far, far away...
Repeat Chorus 3x
Where's your mama gone
Where's your mama gone
Little baby bird
Little baby bird
Where's your mama gone
Where's your mama gone
Far far away
Where's your papa gone
Where's your papa gone
Little baby bird
Little baby bird
Where's your papa gone
