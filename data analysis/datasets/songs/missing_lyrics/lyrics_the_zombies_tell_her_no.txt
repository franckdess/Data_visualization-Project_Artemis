{Intro}
And if she should tell you "come closer"
And if she tempts you with her charms
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me
And if she should tell you "I love you" (whoa)
And if she tempts you with her charms
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't let her down from your arms)
No no no no no (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me
I know she's the kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now
If she tells you "I love you"
Just remember she said that to me
Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no (oh yeah)
No no no no no-no-no-no
(Don't take her love from my arms)
No no no no no
Don't leave me now for her love belongs to me
