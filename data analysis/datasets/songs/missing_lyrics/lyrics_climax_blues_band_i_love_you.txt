When I was younger, man
I hadn't a care
Fooling around
Hitting the town
Growing my hair
You came along
And stole my heart
When you entered my life
Ooh, babe
You got what it takes
So I made you my wife
Since then
I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, oooh
I love you
You came along
From far away
And found me here
I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile
You said
You're much too young
Your life ain't begun
Let's walk for awhile
And as my head was spinning 'round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh
I want you
Thank you, babe
For being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, oooh
I need you
As my head was coming round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh
I want you
Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life
'Cause, oooh
I need you
Since then I never looked back
It's almost like livin' a dream
Oooh
I got you
If ever a man had it all
It would have to be me
And, oooh
I love you
