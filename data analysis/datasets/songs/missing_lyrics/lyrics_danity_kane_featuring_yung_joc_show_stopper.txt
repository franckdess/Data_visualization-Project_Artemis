We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
(Danity Kane)
The boys stare, we smile back
(Jim-Johnson)
All my girls in the rainbow (let's stare boys) Cadillacs, yeah

Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze
Yo, we superstars

Put in the keys, make that engine purr
3 in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin', cause we look that fly
All the boys tryin' taste our candy ride

We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

Bet you ain't never seen (hey)
Chicks ridin' this clean (hey)
Louis Vuitton seats (oh, oh, oh)
We do it daily
This how we keep it poppin' (hey)
Make sure that bass knockin' (hey)
So when you see us ridin' (oh, oh, oh)
We call it show stoppin'
We show stoppin'
We show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin'
We show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin' (hey)
Make sure that bass knockin' (hey)
So when you see us ridin' (oh, oh, oh)
We call it show stoppin'

We sittin' on 22s plus 2
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas
But we ride like big boys do

Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my Bad Boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' 'til they lose their breath
Turn the wheel to the right
Turn the wheel to the left



This is for my ladies in the 280s Mercedes
In the H3, Baby Ranges, Bentley Coupes, my Escalades
Say oh (oh), oh (oh, oh)
Break 'em off somethin' proper
Like a real show stopper

This is for my chicas with the Beamers A6's
'67 Chevys, Maserati, or a Lexus
Say oh, (oh), oh (oh,oh )
Break 'em off somethin' proper
Like a real show stopper

Gon' jingle them keys
Gon' jingle them keys
Put em' up real high
Make sho' everybody see em'
One time (one time)
Two time (two time)
Three time (three time)
Four time (four time)
