(Hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land
(Bring the beat back)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
(Justified)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land
(Ancients of Mu Mu)
(Mu Mu Land)
(Mu Mu Land)
(All bound for Mu Mu Land)

They're Justified, and they're Ancient
And they like to roam the land
(Just roll it from the top)
They're Justified, and they're Ancient
I hope you understand
(To the bridge, to the bridge, to the bridge now)

They called me up in Tennessee
They said "Tammy, stand by The Jams"
But if you don't like what they're going to do
You better not stop them 'cause they're coming through

(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (justified)
(Ancients of Mu Mu)

Mu Mu Land
Mu Mu Land
All bound for Mu Mu Land

They're Justified, and they're Ancient
And they drive an ice cream van
(Just roll it from the top)
They're Justified and they're Ancient
With still no master plan
(To the bridge, to the bridge, to the bridge now)

The last train left an hour ago
They were singing "All aboard"
All bound for Mu Mu Land
Then someone starting screaming "Turn up the Strobe"
(Bring the beat back)

(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (Justified)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (Ancients of Mu Mu)
(Hey hey)
(All bound for Mu Mu Land)
(Hey hey)
(Justified)
(All bound for Mu Mu Land) (Ancients of Mu Mu)
(Bring the beat back)

Justified and Ancient, Ancient and a-justified
Rocking to the rhythm in their ice cream van
With the plan and the key to
Enter into Mu Mu
Vibes from the tribes of the Jams
I know where the beat is at
'Cause I know what time it is
Three on the dot
Make mine a "99"
New style, meanwhile, always on a mission while
Fishing in the rivers of life
Fishing in the rivers of life (hey)
Fishing in the rivers of life (hey)
Fishing in the rivers
Fishing in the rivers
Fishing in the rivers of life (hey)

Voo-va-voolie
Za-shi-va-zom
Voo-va-voolie
(Bring the beat back)

(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (Justified)
(Hey hey)
All bound for Mu Mu Land (Ancients of Mu Mu)

They have travelled the world
With their ice cream van
Their voyage to the bottom of time
They have entered the place
Where the Mu Mu mate
And the children still cry:
"Mine's a '99'"
(Bring the beat back)

Voo-va-voolie
Za-shi-va-zom
Voo-va-voolie
Voo-va-voolie
