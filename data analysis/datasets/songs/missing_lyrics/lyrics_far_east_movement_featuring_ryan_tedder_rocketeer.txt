Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Up, up here we go, go
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows, knows

Where we go we don't need roads (roads)
And where we stop nobody knows (knows)
To the stars if you really want it
Got got a jetpack with your name on it
Above the clouds in the atmosphere ('phere)
Just say the words and we out of here (outta here)
Hold my hand if you feeling scared (scared)
We flying up up out of here


Baby we can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo, get you fly kicks
Girl you always on my mind, got my head up in the sky
And I'm never looking down feeling priceless (yeah)
Where we at, only few have known
Go on the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, cardio
Til' then let's fly, Geronimo


Now I never been in space before
But I never seen a face like yours
You make me feel like I could touch the planets
You want the moon girl watch me grab it
See I ain't never seen a star this close
You got me stuck by the way you glow
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh
