I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It makes me hurt so bad to see you again
Like needles and pins
People say "you've been making out okay
He's in love don't stand in his way"
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before please love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Hurt so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm begging you please
Oooooh oh oh oh
Come back it hurts so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
I'm begging you please
Oh! No!
Noooooo!
