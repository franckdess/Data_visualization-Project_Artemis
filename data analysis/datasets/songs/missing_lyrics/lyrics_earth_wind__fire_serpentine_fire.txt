When I see your face
Like a mornin' sun
You spark me to shine
Tell all the world
My need is fulfilled
And that's a new design
As long as you're near
There is no fear
Of a victory
All right
But when I'm away
Influences stray
My mind to disagree
I wanna see your face
In a morning sun
Ignite my energy, ow
The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
In my life to me
Gonna tell the story o'
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story o'
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I need to see your face
Like a morning sun
Ignite my energy, huh
The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
In my life to me
The moments I find
When I'm inclined
To do my best, oh
The negative wins
When I give in and
Then I lose the test
(Not many times)
Gonna tell the story o'
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire
Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story o'
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story o'
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
