No more timing
Each tear that falls from my eyes
I`m not hiding the remedy
To cure this old heart of mine

I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

Moving sidewalks
I don`t see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below
Where the streets
See me lonely for you, oh

I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

(I can dream about you)
I`m gonna press
My lips against you
And hold you to me
(I can dream about you)
You know you got me
Spellbound
What else can it be?
Moving sidewalks
I don`t see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart
Cause it`s you that I need
I can dream
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
I can dream
Yes, I can dream
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh
I don`t understand it
Can`t keep my mind off loving you
(Not even for a minute)
Oooh
Now baby
I`m caught up in the magic
I see in you
There`s one thing to do

I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
Oh, I can dream about you
If I can`t hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Oh, I can dream
I can dream
I can dream about you
I can dream about you
