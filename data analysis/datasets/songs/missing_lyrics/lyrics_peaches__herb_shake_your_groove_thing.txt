There's nothing more that I'd like to do
Than take the floor and dance with you
Keep dancing
Let's keep dancing
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show 'em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show 'em how we do it now
Show 'em how we do it now
Let's show the world we can dance
Bad enough to strut our stuff
The music gives us a chance
We do more out on the floor
Grooving loose
Or heart to heart
We put in motion
Every single part
Funky sounds
Wall to wall
We`re bumping booties
Having us a ball, y'all
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now
We got the rhythm tonight
All the rest know we`re the best
Our shadows crash in the light
Twisting
Turning
We keep burning
Shake it high or shake it low
We take our bodies
Where they wanna go
Feel that beat
Never stop
Oh, hold me tight
Spin me like a top
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing
Yeah, yeah
Show em how we do it now
There`s nothing more that I`d like to do
Than take the floor and dance with you
Keep dancing
Let's keep dancing
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Grooving loose
Or heart to heart
We put in motion
Every single part
Funky sounds
Wall to wall
We're bumping booties
Having us a ball, y`all
Shake your groove thing
