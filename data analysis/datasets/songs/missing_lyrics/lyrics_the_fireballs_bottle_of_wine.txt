Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over

Ramblin' around
This dirty old town
A-singin' for nickles and dimes
Times gettin' rough
I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine
Yeah

Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over

A pain in my head
There's bugs in my bed
My pants are so old that they shine
Out on the street
I tell the people I meet
To buy me a bottle of wine
Whoa!

Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over
Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over
Bottle of wine
Fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober?
Leave me alone
Let me go home
Let me go home and start over

Let me go home and start over
Let me go home and start over
