Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway
And then maybe some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway
And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you fall down to the ground
And then somedayyour friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh so high
But then someday people look at you
For what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then someday we can take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey but you left me far behind
Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now I'm saying, maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer
Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I lived with what I've known
And then maybe we might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone
And then someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon
You should have told me, hey
Hey but you left me far behind
Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my lord
See I know
See I know
But maybe, said maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway, sayin' now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
Now I've said, but times have changed
Your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer, yeah they hold you down, hold on down
Now I said maybe, maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind
