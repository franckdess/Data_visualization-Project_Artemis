So many ladies
(Yea, I go by the name of Cassidy)
Ladies, ladies, ladies
(And I got love for the ladies fo real)
Ladies
(Remix)
We're vacationin' somewhere on an island
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Drinks of all kinds
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself, girl
And I wanna get wit you 'cuz you's a cutie
Just when you thought I was done, I come wit the remix
But this for the hood, good J O B Swiss
Yeah, I spit rhymes but I grind to see chix
Come, see the strip, it's like takin' a ski trip
Zero degree wrist, 80 a whop
My chain blingy pinky, full of radiant rocks
I ain't Chingy, I'm outside the hotel party
Passenger side wit Rob in the Ferrari
I smoke and get high like I'm a Marley
Wit the mamis you can find me where the bar be
It's hot as hell in here, got Kels in here
You can smell in the air, we got L's in here
Got Cris got Hyp, got Belvedere
And ain't nuttin' but pretty females in here, yeah
It's so terrific on the boat, we can float the Pacific
And vacation on an island, I ain't know existed
We're vacationin' somewhere on an island
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Drinks of all kinds
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself, girl
And I wanna get wit you 'cuz you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cuz we havin' a after party
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
Miss Trina and I'm off the chain
And you know I do my thing in the Vera Wang
So fresh, so clean, 20 karat pinky ring
I'm the best chick in Alexander McQueen
And I'm back on the scene, da chick of your dreams
You making me cream and you love when I scream
Now you's a real playa, Cassidy, but tell the truth
You know a chick as bad as me?
Oh, after the party is the after party
In the penthouse suite and we actin' naughty
Dis chicks so nice, got the cris so nice
In the hotel room thoia thoing all nite
And you know I'm ready, L'Pearle teddy
Rock the boat steady till I'm hot and sweaty
In the hotel, motel make you wanna go tell
Your homeboys how I put it on you so well
We're vacationin' somewhere on an island
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Drinks of all kinds
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Girl, you wanna come to my hotel
Baby, I'll leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry your'self, girl
And I wanna get wit you 'cuz yous a cutie
So, if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cuz we're havin' a after party
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
If there's anybody dat do it big in the hotel
Its me, see I practically live in the hotel
I put in work in the street, so I can afford
To spend 10 grand on room service a week
I got the top chef makin' my lunch
And the tip the waiter get prolly more than he make in a month
I'm in the hot tub breaking a blunt
I got 4 freaks in my suite all getting naked at once
While their girlfriends wait in the front, I got plenty cigars
And plenty bottles and they not from the mini bar
I got Swissy lookin' out for me, I'm in the 'Presidential'
You can see the whole city from my balcony
We're vacationin' somewhere on an island
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Drinks of all kinds
(We chillin', we chillin', we chillin', we chillin')
Girl, you wanna cum to my hotel
Baby, I'll leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself, girl
And I wanna get wit you 'cuz you's a cutie
So, if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
'Cuz we havin' a after party
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
