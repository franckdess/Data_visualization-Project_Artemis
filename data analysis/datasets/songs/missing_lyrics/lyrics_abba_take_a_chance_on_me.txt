Take a chance on me
That's all I ask of you honey
Take a chance on me

We can go dancing, we can go walking
As long as we're together (As long as we're together)
Listen to some music, maybe just talking
Get to know you better (Get to know you better)

'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go

Take a chance on me
Come on, give me a break, will you?
Take a chance on me

Oh, you can take your time, baby, I'm in no hurry
Know I'm gonna get ya (Know I'm gonna get ya)
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry
I ain't gonna let you (I ain't gonna let ya)

Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
It's magic
You say that I waste my time, but I can't get you off my mind
No, I can't let go
'Cause I love you so
