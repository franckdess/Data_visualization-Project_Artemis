Let's go, dip it low, then you bring it up slow
Wind it up one time, wind it back once more

Everybody move, run
Lemme see you move and rock it 'til the groove done
Shake it 'til the moon becomes the sun (Sun)
Everybody in the club, give me a run (Run)
If you ready to move say it (Yeah)
One time for your mind say it (Yeah, yeah)
Well, I'm ready for ya
Come let me show ya
You want to groove, I'mma show you how to move
