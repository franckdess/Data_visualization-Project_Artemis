I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel for sorry for any man out there
When he can't look around
And say, this is my woman
My woman alone
I feel sorry, yeah
For any woman out there
Who can't say I got somebody
That I can call my very own
I feel sorry, I feel sorry
I feel sorry, I feel sorry
One thing I can say about the people of the world today
They see you with a good thing
They want to take it away
But I believe in you, you believe in me too, yeah
Even your best friend will come around making sly remarks
Trying to put you down
I believe in you, you believe in me too
Listen honey, people talking, trying to pull us apart
Sticking pins and needles in both of our hearts
I love you no matter
Don't care about the stormy weather
I heard your mother say
Loving me didn't make no sense
But when she put me down
You stood up in my defense
I believe in you
Anytime you against your own mother
It makes me know
You believe in me, yeah
Here's another thing
We had our hard times
And almost didn't make it
We always worked it
Never tried to fake it
But I believe in you
You believe in me too
Here's anything about it
People talking, trying to pull us apart
Always ticking pins and needles in both of our hearts
Our love together
Don't care about the stormy weather
I believe in you
You believe in me too, yeah
I believe, that's why every time we get a chance
I tell you, honey, how much I love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
And most of all, how much I trust you
The reason why I trust you, baby
Is because of one thing
I can lean on you, yeah, baby
And you can lean on me too
One more time I'm gonna say
I believe in you
Honey, please let me believe in you
I know a lot of folk out there
Wish they had somebody they could believe in
I believe, I believe in you
You believe in me too
Anytime you against your own mother
It makes me know
You believe in me
I believe in you
And you've shown me enough to know
You believe in me too
