There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
(Ooh, ooh)
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Touch your face)
But the truth remains you're

Gone (You're)
Gone (Baby you're)
Gone (Girl you're gone, baby girl you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone (You're)

Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone...no, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
(Take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do, yeah

I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind (get you off of my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong (my best to be a man and be strong)
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face (Wishing I could touch your face)
But the truth remains you're (truth remains you're)

Gone (You're)
Gone (you're)
Gone (You're gone, you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone
(Ohhh...)

What will I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where will I turn to
Baby who will I be
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart
Baby why don't you see
That I need you here with me
Oh...

I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man)
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Ooh pinch you baby, Oh)
But the truth remains (the truth remains you're gone)
I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man)
I drove myself insane (Oh, oh, oh)
Wishing I could touch your face
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
But the truth remains you're....
(Oh, oh...Baby the truth is you're)

Gone (You're)
Gone (You're)
Gone (You're gone, baby girl you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone

But the truth remains you're...
