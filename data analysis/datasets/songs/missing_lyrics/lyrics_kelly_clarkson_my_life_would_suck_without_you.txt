Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

Maybe I was stupid for tellin' you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for tryna pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go
Oh, yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you
'Cause we belong together now, yeah (Together now)
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you
