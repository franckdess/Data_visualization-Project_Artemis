When I think about your loving
The Sunday evenings
The fun we use to share
Looking through the
Memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried
And thought it over
Now I realize
That it's never over
Only set aside

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
I will never be free
From your embrace, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not
Too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Ever always been captured
By your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right
There by your side
Right by your side

Lying here alone, I'm dreaming
My mind keeps wanderin
My thoughts are only you
Wandering through the
Memories in my mind
How could love so real
Have gone so empty
I just keep wondering why
Will I ever find the love
We shared together, you and I

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
Though we've had
Such a long hard road
To climb, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not
Too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't you try and believe
In what I say, sweet baby
I will always be
Right here by your side
Right by your side


Oh, it's you, sweet baby
I will never be free
From your embrace, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not
Too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Ever always been captured
By your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right
There by your side
Right by your side
