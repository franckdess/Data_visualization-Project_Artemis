For All We Know
Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say and as we go on from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow for all we know
Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
Let's take a lifetime to say
I know you well
But only time will tell us so
And love may grow for all we know
