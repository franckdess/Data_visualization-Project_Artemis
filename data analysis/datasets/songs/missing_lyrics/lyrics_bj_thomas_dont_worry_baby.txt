Well, it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinkin'
Somethings bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
When she says
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
(Baby)
Each morning I awake and find
The sunlight softly shining in her hair
And then I realize that I'm only
Thinkin' that she really doesn't care
There's magic in her eyes
That makes me come alive
When she says
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
She told me Baby, when you leave today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
