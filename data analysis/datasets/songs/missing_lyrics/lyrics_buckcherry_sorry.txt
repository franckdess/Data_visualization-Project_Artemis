Oh, I had a lot to say
Was thinking on my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same

'Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me want to die

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

This time, I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame

'Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry, it makes me want to die

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

Every single day
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah, I'm sorry

I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all things I said to you
And I know, I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby, the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry
