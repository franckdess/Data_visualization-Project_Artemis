Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!
You don't ever need help from nobody else. All you got to do now:
Express Yourself!
What ever you do, do it good
What ever you do, do it good. All right...
It's not what you look like, when you're doin' what you're doin'
It's what you're doin' when you're doin' what you look like you're doin'!
Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!
They're doin'it on the moon, yeah...
In the jungle too
Everybody on the floor, now
Jumpin' like a kangaroo
So let the horns do the thing they do, yo...
Some people have everything, and other people don't
But everything don't mean a thing if it ain't the thing you want
Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!
O, do it! O, do it
Do it to it. Go on and do it
Yo, do it. Give
Express Yourself!
