Some people are made of plastic
And you know some people are made of wood
Some people have hearts of stone
Some people are up to no good
But baby, I'm for real
I'm as real as real can get
If what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
I said, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)
And the real thing is the best thing yet (the best thing yet)
You know some people are made of lies
To bring you down and shame your name
But baby, I have good intentions
'Cause breaking hearts just ain't my game
All I want to do is love you
And sugar, I won't fill you with regret, no, no
If what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
I mean, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)
And the real thing is the best thing yet (the best thing yet)
