Now when I holla A Bay Bay, I'm finna get my groove on
It's so hot up in the club that I ain't got no shoes on
Holdin' up a big stack of dem hunnids in a rubber band
So don't ask me for no cash
Cause I'm not that other man
Everybody tripping cause I'm limping when I'm walking
And I'm pimping when I'm talking
I don't trick 'em when I'm talking
Them boys in the back
They be rollin' up they dopey
And they blow until choke
And that's what got his got his game flossin'
Wen I see a bad chick I'm hollerin' out A Bay Bay
Hope ya'll ain't with your boyfriend
Cuz I don't care what they say
And I don't care what he say, or she say
I'm in the DJ booth takin' pics. with the DJ

Now if you looking for me baby
You can find me banging in the Chevy
Candy painted swinging 90
Big cars creep with my people right behind me
I showed 'em my chain
And now she hollering where you finding me
Show my mouth piece to them freaks
Now they hiring me
Oh you gotta fire them well I hope you ain't trying me
Throw the car in park then I reach under my seat
Hop out with my hand under my shirt
That's where that 9 be
Yellow bone chirpin me
She tryna see where I be
You goin' to let me get in your mouth
Well that's where I'mma be
Unpop trunk with lights, that's where the chopper be
Straight to the hotel
All the baddest chicks followin me
I know you like my style

And if you thinking I'mma stunt? You tripping
I pulled up in an expedition with the roof missin'

I'm in the club hot, crunk, sweating, burning up
I'm bouncin' thru the crowd
Bucking, and hollering wassup
When I done fell out on the dance floor, and now I can't get up
J's on ya feet but you can't get these
Louis Vuitton brown, white, and yellow trick please
I go to Saint Louis and let my chain hang low
Canary yellow diamonds mixed with rose gold
I shine real bright in the light cause I'm a star
8 shots of patron now I'm standing on the bar
Tried to get drunk as a skunk and put the keys in the wrong car
Prolly got drunk as a skunk and put the keys in the wrong car
