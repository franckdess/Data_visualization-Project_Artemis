Tell your daddy and your mama too
You got something better to do
Than stick around the house the rest of your life
You're eighteen you can do what you like
You'll be the queen of my highway, my motorcycle mama
And we'll see the world from my Harley
We'll get matching jackets and helmets too
We'll get respect from the towns we ride through
We'll sleep at the roadside in the soft green grass
And if the squares walk by, we'll let them pass
You'll be the queen of my highway, my motorcycle mama
And we'll see the world from my Harley
And maybe in a year or two
We'll have a little one, she'll look just like you
We'll add on a sidecar
Electric guitar
And we'll be a trio
The baby makes three, oh
Tell your daddy and your mama too
You got something better to do
Than stick around the house the rest of your life
You're eighteen you can be my wife
You'll be the queen of my highway, my motorcycle mama
And we'll see the world from my Harley
And we'll see the world from my Harley
And we'll see the world from my Harley, if the chain don't break
