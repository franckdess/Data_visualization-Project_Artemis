Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide, and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
But you go hide, and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak
Aww yeah, first verse

I'm thinking about you, every day
Got me feelin' kinda freaky
Girl, why you wanna leave me that way?
Boy, I don't wanna leave you
So I'll stay for a little while
But we play by my rules
'Cause bein' loose just ain't my style
No no no no ohhhh

Let me be the one to make you weak
