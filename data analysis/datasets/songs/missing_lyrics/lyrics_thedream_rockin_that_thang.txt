Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be yours

Radio killa

Now she the definition of fine
But I told her that her body looks better with mine. 

I like the way she rock, her hips
Them rockin' hips
Told her we can take off like rocket ships
Straight jacket jeans, you look crazy in em'
The way you rockin' that, I thought they were jay z denim
Let me drop a jewel on ya, put a roc in air
Can I call you nana cause you got that rockin' chair
It go back & forth- then forth & back
When I'm on patron or off the yak
Cnt get off the fact I'm off my mac
Goldie prolly wouldn't, but I would trick off of that
And I'm sick with the money, I can cough a stack
I can sneeze some g's so baby let's roll

She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love
She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
There's nothing I can say 
She rockin' that shit like

Whoa, whoa
Look how shorty roll, roll
She rockin' that shit
I'm like look at shorty go, go
She rockin' to the beat, she rockin' it for me
And all I can think about is rockin' it to sleep
Her face is like a model
Body shape just like a bottle
Girl I wanna hit that more than I wanna hit the lotto
She revvin' me up, I got my hand on my throttle
I wanna get on top of her, zoom on the yamaha
So you can call it switchin' gears
Zoom inside of her
And if it taste how it look I'm a try to swallow her
Call me Mr. Shoe- shine, baby I'm a polish ya
And I leave ya spit clean, I dnt use no polisher
Demolition man, tell your friends I demolish ya
Plus I'm that nigga, baby I could make you popular
So get another shot of ciroc in ya
Cause I'm gon' be rockin' ya
Treat you like my first ladt
I'll put my barack in ya

She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love
She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
There's nothing I can say 
She rockin' that shit like

Fresh as a black president one
Air force ones in my air force one (obama)
Is it all a dream? (no) sorry my reality
See me rockin' that shit is complementing my salary
Complementary balance, told em' what we tally
Spinning like it's ballet & I touched the budget ballot (boss)
See the girl, & holla (eyy)
Told me that she from the (a)
So you know I had to (eyy) classify my case

She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love
She rockin' that shit like
The way you rockin' that up in this club
There's nothing I can say 
She rockin' that shit like

Now let me take you to a place far beyond
In a whole nother galaxy
Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality
Melt your imagination, & mold it into reality
Your hearts me art gallery girl
Can you feel the pictures that I painted
Cause all of them are related like a mother & a son
But none of them overrated
There no others, you the one
Our destiny is to make it
Gotta thank you just for sharing your world
It's so real, an inspiration for no reason
But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangable
The thought is sensational, it's perfect bliss
I'm ready to take the milky way to your hershey's kiss
You know my tongue's got batteries in it
The bedroom, we lose calories in it & start families in it
And dnt worry cause the situations under control
So let me dive in your heart & swim around in your soul (luda)

Take me, I'm yours, shorty
As we rock to the left, rock to the right
Lend me your body & we'll rock it all nite
Tell the niggas hollaback, tell your girls goodnite
The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gonna make a nigga fall in love
