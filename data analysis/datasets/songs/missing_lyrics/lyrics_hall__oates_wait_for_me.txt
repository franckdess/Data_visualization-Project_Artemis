Midnight hour almost over
Time is running out for the magic pair
I know you gave the best that you have
But one more chance
Couldn't be all that hard to bear

Wait for me, please
Wait for me
Oh
I guess that's more than I should ask
Why won't you wait for me (Wait for me)
Please, wait for me (Wait for me)
Although I know the light is fading fast

You could go either way
Is it easier to stay
I wonder what you'll do
When your chance rolls around
But you gotta know how much I want to keep you
When I'm away I'm afraid it will all fall down
Please, wait for me (Wait for me)

So, wait for me, please
(Wait for me)
Alright, I guess that's more than I should ask
But, won't you wait for me (Wait for me)
Although I know the light is fading fast
(Interlude)
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La (x4)

Love is what it does and ours is doing nothing
But all the time we spent, it must be good for something
Please forgive all the disturbance I'm creating
But you got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you

So, wait for me, please
Wait for me
Oh I, I guess that's more than I should ask
So, won't you wait for me (Wait for me)
Please, wait for me (For me)
Oh God, I know the light is fading fast

La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-Later
You've got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you

So, wait for me, please
Wait for me
Alright, I guess that's more than I should ask
So, won't you wait for me (Wait for me)
Please, wait for me (For me)
Oh no, I know the light is fading fast, yes it is

La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-Later
You've got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you
