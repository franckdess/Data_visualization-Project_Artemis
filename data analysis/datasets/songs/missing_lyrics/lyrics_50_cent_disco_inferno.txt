One, two, three, let's go!

Li'l mama, show me how you move it

Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl!

Go, go, go, 50 in the house
Bounce, y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums, nigga
I ain't stupid, I say Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
Girl, watch, I'm like bounce that ass, girl
I get it crunk in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here, we'll thump in here, oh!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club with the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh

Let's party! Everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party! Everybody bounce with me
Sip champagne and burn a little greenery

It's hot! Disco inferno
Let's go! You're now rocking with a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look, homie, I don't dance, all I do is this
It's the same two step wit a li'l twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' with a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we finna carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon' be up in this bitch till we break daylight (daylight)

You see me shining, lit up with diamonds
Cause I stay grindin', uh-huh
Homie, you can catch me swooping
Bentley coupin' switching lanes, haha
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah
Nigga, I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay, let's go
