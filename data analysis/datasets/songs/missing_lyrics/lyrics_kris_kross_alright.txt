Just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'
Somethin' real smooth, hahaha
You can just ride to
Tell me how you feel
Here we go...

Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, say we haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
(Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, see...)
The bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school, and I passed
No moms trippin', so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says "I am what I am, that's who I be"
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me...
(With the braids, the shades, some pants and some Nikes, G)
And nothin' mo' better then a letter sayin'
"I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?" Yesssss!
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
(Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj)
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Representin BG's and comin' up strong, and...
(We ain't got no love for the side)
We only love those who love us back, right?

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...
Tell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight
Tell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright
Come in the place and you feeling right
They come in the place and you hold your girl tight
Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know, really d'know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school, back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris?
I said "Ya warm it up Chris?"
That's what I was born to do!

Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin', is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I came out right
Unlike those moles who tried to "Pass Da Mic"
It's the Daddy Mac (Big baby!)
Everything is real but you wanna diss cause a nigga sold a couple mill
(Look here...) Ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you diss it just lets me know I'm on your mind, and it's alright

Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight
It no matter if you’re black, it no matter if you’re white
Just come in de house make we all unite
Tell dem Kriss Kross and dem a drop on de mic and make we dance until the morning light
Tell dem Kriss Kross a de people’s choice we haffi dance until de day light
Your girl inna de place and your hold her tight and dance to the people’s choice
Tell dem Kriss Kross dem a tear down de mic, dance hard cause the vibes is right
Tell Mista Cat pon de mic Ah ha ha ha

It don't stop, it don't stop...
Check it out!
It don't stop, it don't stop...
Check it out!
It don't stop, it don't stop...
