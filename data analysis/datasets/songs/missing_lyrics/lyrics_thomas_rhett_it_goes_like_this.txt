Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home
Get you outta here and get you all alone
I don't know what it is about you, baby
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy
But you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

Lookin' at you lookin' at me that way (Lookin' at me that way)
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play

Something like ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on my heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like hey, girl, I'm blown away
Yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

And it goes like ooh, and it goes like hey
And it ends with a kiss
Yeah, it goes like this
