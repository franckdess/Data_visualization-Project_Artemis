From the club to the coupe, inside my gates
Up in my bedroom, screamin' each others' names (Oh! Ugh)
They was purrty-purrty, and I was flirty-flirty
Lil' dro, lil' bub, now they gettin' dirty-dirty
Don't ask me what my name is—stupid bitch, I'm famous
You gon' make me aim this, leave your ass brainless
I'm tryin' to stay R&B, but these streets is a part of me
So don't get it twisted!
You see I order one bottle then I fuck with one model
Then I order more bottles; now I got more models
I'm from that city where them niggas don't play, man

Stay shine, rockin' Gucci in the Bentley (Super-fly)
