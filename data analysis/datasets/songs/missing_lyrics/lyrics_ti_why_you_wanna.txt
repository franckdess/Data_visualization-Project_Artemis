Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
