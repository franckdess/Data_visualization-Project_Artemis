I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy, have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive, yeah
Call it passive or aggressive

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

You're the only one invited
I said there's no one else for you
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why)
I still get jealous

Oh (That's why)
I still get jealous
Oh (That's why)
I still get jealous
