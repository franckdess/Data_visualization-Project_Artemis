I can see
We're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see
Your expression when the phone rings
We both know
There's something happening here
There's no sense
In dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse
When it's treated with neglect
Well, don't turn now
There's nothing here to fear
You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby
Dusty words
Lying under carpets
Seldom heard
Well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside
Hidden deep from view
Do I seem all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well, I've searched
Through all my cards
Well, isn't that enough
You can hide your hurt
But there's something you can do
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me
Though we lay face to face
And cheek to cheek
Our voices stray
From common ground where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear
(Tear, tear, tear)
Let the walls burn down
Set your secret free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here
You can talk to me
Talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone rings
And I can see
That we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, now you've taken all my dreams
Isn't that enough?
Well I can see you, baby
Well I can see you, baby
Talk to me, yeah
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone rings
