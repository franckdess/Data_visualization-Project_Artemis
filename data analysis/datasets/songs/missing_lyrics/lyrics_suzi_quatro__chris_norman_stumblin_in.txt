:
Our love is alive and so we begin
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame burnin' within
Now and then firelight will catch us, stumblin' in
:
Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are followin' you
:
I've fallen for you, whatever you do
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew
:
Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you
:
Our love is alive and so we begin
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame burnin' within
Now and then firelight will catch us, stumblin' in
:
You were so young, ah, and I was so free
:
I may have been young but baby that's not what I wanted to be
:
Well, you were the one
:
Oh, why was it me?
:
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I'd never seen
:
Whatever you need, baby, you got it from me
:
Our love is alive and so we begin
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame burnin' within
Now and then firelight will catch us, stumblin' in
Stumblin' in, stumblin' in
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Ahh, stumblin' in, mmm, stumblin' in
Now and then fire light will catch us, stumblin' in
Ahh, stumblin' in, ahh, stumblin' in
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Ahh, stumblin' in, you were stimblin' in...
