Well I just heard the news today
It seems my life is going to change
I closed my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life

With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Wide open


If I had just one wish only one demand
I hope he's not like me, I hope he understands
That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open

With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
