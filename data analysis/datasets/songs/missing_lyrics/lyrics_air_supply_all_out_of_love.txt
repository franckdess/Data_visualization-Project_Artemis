I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but
What else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For the times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone...

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

Oh, what are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong
