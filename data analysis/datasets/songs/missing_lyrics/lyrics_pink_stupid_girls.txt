Uh-huh, uh-huh
Stupid girl, stupid girls, stupid girls

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
(Break it down now)

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore!
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (Come on)

Disasters all around (Disasters all around)
A world of despair (A world of despair)
Your only concern: "Will it fuck up my hair?"

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Do ya think, and do ya think, do ya think?)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair, I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
(Baby, if I) Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back
(Baby, if I) Push up my bra like that, stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that (Maybe if I act like that)
That guy will call me back (That guy will call me back)
Porno paparazzi girl (Porno paparazzi girl)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Stupid girls)
Baby, if I act like that (Baby, if I act like that)
Flippin' my blonde hair back (Flipping my blonde hair back)
Push up my bra like that (Push up my bra like that)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Stupid girls)

Baby, if I act like that (Stupid girls)
Flipping my blonde hair back (Stupid girls)
Push up my bra like that (Stupid girls)
Stupid girls
(Stupid girls) Stupid girl
(Stupid girls) Stupid girls
(Stupid girls) Stupid girl
(Stupid girls)
(Stupid girls)
