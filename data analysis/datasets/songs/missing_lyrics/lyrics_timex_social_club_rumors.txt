How do rumors get started?
They’re started by the jealous people
And they get mad
Seeing something they had
And somebody else is holding
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
But these wicked women
Ooh, they just persist
Maybe you think it’s cute
But girl, I’m not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business
Please don’t mess
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
Hear the one about Tina
Some say she’s much too loose
That came straight from a guy
Who claims he’s tasted her juice
Did you hear the one about Michael
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue, but they said
If he was straight he wouldn’t move that way
Did you hear that one about Susan, some say she’s just a tease
In a camisole, she’s six feet tall, she’ll knock you to your knees
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
I can’t go no place without somebody pointing a finger
I can’t show my face cause when it comes to rumors
I’m a dead ringer
It seems from rumors I just can’t get away
I bet there’ll even be rumors floating around on Judgment Day
I’ll think I’ll write my congressman
And tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin’ rumors
Shoot to kill
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
What’s mine is mine
I ain’t got time for rumors in my life
I’m a man who thinks
Not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
What’s mine is mine
I ain’t got time for rumors in my life
I’m a man who thinks
Not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
What’s mine is mine
I ain’t got time for rumors in my life
I’m a man who thinks
Not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from

My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door
