You betta count your money boy

The name is Krayzie, big bad-ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with it so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double crossed by the law so there's nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughtta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin' dark so now now I'm watchin' for them damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin', tootin', shootin' damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse "whoa nellie"
Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? Hope this ain't the lawJar out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
Come on out right now I'm gettin angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job so I told her to ride come on
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you with it
We out before the sunrise
Gotta stallion for ya partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride lets ride
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and hookups

You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)
You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)

Rise and shine, good morning howdy
Nine o clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now I done came along way I don't wanna be late
Tell him we make it to him
You know where we at (Move Out!)

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up
You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)

I'm peepin' Krazyie's warning poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room I see this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approach him and I pause
"Look man I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws
Come messing up this master plan?"
Since he already rowdy I just asked the man, hey
"You want some work, well partna put in ya bid
Now by the was whats your name? They call me Layzie the Kid"
"The names Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw everyday on the front page
Mr Kid, if you give me the low down
Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever"
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin' down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzie's in town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside and dont' be stealin' nobody's damn horses
Stepped inside the bar, Layzie Kid, you son of a gun!
Hey man I'm glad you made it safely
Now let's go have some fun
And this my partner powder hes a young gun
Howdy
Mighty glad to meet ya son
Oh yeah you know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen the horse peddler
Straggler, just met her
Howdy partner
Already got the horses saddled up
I hope you good at robbing banks
Like you rustle that cattle
Now y'all
Its gon' be gettin' dark real soon
I think you right
I say we move come on let's move out!

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)
Giddy up, giddy up
