Cherish, cherish

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love
You're givin' it
You're givin' it to me boy
Keep giving me all-all-all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would
Cherish

Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
