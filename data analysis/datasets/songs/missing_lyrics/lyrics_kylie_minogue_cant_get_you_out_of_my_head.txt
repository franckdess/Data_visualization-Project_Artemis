La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay? Won't you lay?
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever

La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free, feel the need in me
Set me free
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever

La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la

I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
I just can't get you out of my head
La la la, la la la la la
La la la, la la la la la
