{Intro}
Judy in disguise, well that's what you are
A  lemonade pie with your brand new car
Cantaloupe eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses
Keep a-wearing your bracelets and your new Rara
And cross your heart, yeah, with your livin' bra
Chimney Sweep Sparrow with guise
Judy in disguise, with glasses
Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
Taking everything in sight
Except for the strings on my kite
Judy in disguise, hey that's what you are
A lemonade pie, hey,  got your brand new car
So cantaloupe eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses
{Bridge}
Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
I'm taking everything in sight
Except for the strings of my kite
(Oh, Uh oh, Uhhh)
Judy in disguise, what you aiming for?
A circus of a-horrors, yeah yeah, well that's what you are
You made me a life of ashes
(slower) I guess I'll just take your glasses
