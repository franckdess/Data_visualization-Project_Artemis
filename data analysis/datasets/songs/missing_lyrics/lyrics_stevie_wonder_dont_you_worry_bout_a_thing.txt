Eee eee!
Watch this y'all
Comprende señora
See here mama, you understand uh (mm-ah)
Well huh like huh I understand how you can't
I got me a Paris, Beirut you know Iraq, Iran, "Ukraingia" you know
I speak very very um fluent Spanish
Todo 'stá bien chévere' you understand that ? chévere
Yes I mama, I got my shakers

Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip

Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through

But don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama
'Cause I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
(Todo 'stá bien chévere)

Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Todo 'stá bien chévere
