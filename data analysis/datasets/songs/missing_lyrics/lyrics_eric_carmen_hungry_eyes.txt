I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feeling
That won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you
And I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I want to hold you
So hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about
Darling
Tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you
And I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With the hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise?
I need you to see
This love was meant to be

I've got hungry eyes
One look at you
And I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With the hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise?
With my hungry eyes
I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With my hungry eyes
