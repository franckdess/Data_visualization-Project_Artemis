You know I won't forget the times
We shared together holding hands
And walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I've no regrets
Can't you tell from
The look on my face
That I love you more today

The first time
I looked into your eyes
I cried
Do you remember the first time
We fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time
When we fell in love

Although some time has passed
I still remember
Just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast
The love I have for you
Time won't ever change
I always feel the same
Now until the end
Memories we share
Will live forever
Deep inside my heart
I know I'll never forget



Oh, when we fell in love
