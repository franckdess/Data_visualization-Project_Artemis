Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes, I did
Oh, I escaped (Aha ha)
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me
Uh huh

With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, oh
I knew you were waiting, hey, I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny, ooh boy, ooh!
I know this love we share was meant to be, oh
(Knew you were waiting) Ooh, yeah
(Knew you were waiting) I knew you were waiting
(Knew you were waiting for me)

(I didn't falter) I didn't falter, no
(I still believed) When the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) Nothing can stop me, no
(I knew you were waiting) No, I
(I knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) When the mountain was high
(I still believed) Oh, when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) No, it didn't stop me, no
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) Oh, oh yeah
(I still believed) Oh, I still believed
(It didn't stop me) Do you know it couldn't stop me now? No
(Knew you were waiting)
Someday (someday), somehow (somehow)
For me
(I didn't falter) When the valley was low
(I still believed) I still believe (I believed, I believed)
(It didn't stop me) Yeah, it couldn't stop me
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting for me)
