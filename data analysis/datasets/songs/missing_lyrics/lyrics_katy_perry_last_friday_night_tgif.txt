There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

But this Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night, do it all again
(Do it all again) This Friday night

T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F
