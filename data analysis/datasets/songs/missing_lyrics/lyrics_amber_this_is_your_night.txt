This is your night
Dancing free until the morning light
Together forever 'cause this is your night
And everything is gonna be alright
Oh yeah
So in love with you
Oh yeah
It's too good to be true
Oh yeah
Feeling so brand new
Oh yeah

You captured my heart, you're the key to my life
A vision of our love that made me survive
Creating the mood that we're in is surreal
It's time to move up and to face what I feel

This is your night
Dancing free until the morning light
Together forever 'cause this is your night
And everything is gonna be alright
Oh yeah
So in love with you
Oh yeah
It's too good to be true
Oh yeah
Feeling so brand new
Oh yeah

Imagine my spirit, the one that you call
I'm ready to stand up and ready to fall
I can't run away, so attracted by you
I may be your girl and I'll be so true
Oh-oh

This is your night
Dancing free until the morning light
Together forever 'cause this is your night
And everything is gonna be alright
Oh yeah
So in love with you
Oh yeah
It's too good to be true
Oh yeah
Feeling so brand new
Oh yeah
