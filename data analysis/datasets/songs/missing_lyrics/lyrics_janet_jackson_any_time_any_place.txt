In the thundering rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips, ooh

I don't wanna stop just because
People walking by are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no
I want you
All I wanna say is

Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around, mmm
Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around, no, no, no, no, no

Dancing on the floor
Feeling the slow groove
My mind is starting to burn
With forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could
Well... you know

I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop baby)
People standing around are watching us (Standing around are watching us)
I don't give a damn what they think (I don't give a damn)
I want you now (I want you now)
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop)
You feel so good inside of my love (Inside of my love)
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no (No, no, no)
I want you ((I want you now))
All I wanna say is

Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Any time baby
And any place
I don't care who's around (Say it again, say it, oh yeah)
Any time (Any time)
And any place
I don't care who's around
Baby, baby
I don't care who's around
Any time baby
Any place sugar
They pass, they can stare I don't care who's around
