I can tell you that love is too deep to be played on
Down the line, you'd find time would reveal who to count on
I'm well inclined to use the lines that comes from the learning tree
Let the seed that grows, and ages old give us our destiny

Baby, you know, I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would pick you up, never let you down
If you fall in love with me

If you're having second thoughts from the past I can cool you out
I've been there before, right down to the core I can sing and shout
I can't hold back what I feel I bring experience
I'll be your rock when Gibraltar falls, baby, give me a cause

Baby, you know, I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would pick you up, never let you down
If you fall in love with me
Baby, in love with me, find yourself a part of me
Baby, in love with me, help yourself to all of me
Falling in love
Falling in love
Baby, you know, I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would pick you up, never let you down
If you fall in love with me
Baby, in love with me, find yourself a part of me
Baby, in love with me, help yourself to all of me

Can you fall in love?
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Can you fall in love with me?

Baby, you know, I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
