When I took you out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on
Now I bring you home
You tell me good night's not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
Whoa, I didn't mean to turn you on
You read me wrong
I wasn't tryin' to lead you on
Not like you think
I didn't mean to turn you on
I know you
Expected a one-night-stand
When I refused, I knew you wouldn't understand
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice
Only trying to be nice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
Hey, now why should I
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give
Guilty 'cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on
Whoa, I didn't mean to turn you on
When I took you out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on
Whoa, I didn't mean to turn you on
Didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on
