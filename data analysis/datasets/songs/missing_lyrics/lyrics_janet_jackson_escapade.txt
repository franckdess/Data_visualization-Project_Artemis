As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind
My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
Ooh all week
I cashed my check I'm ready to go
I promise you I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

Es-ca-pade
We'll have a good time
Es-ca-pade
Leave your worries behind
Es-ca-pade
Well you can be mine
Es-ca-pade
An escapade

So don't hold back
Just have a good time
We'll make the rules up
As we go along
And break them all
If we're not havin' fun

Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
On an escapade, baby
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
On an escapade, baby
