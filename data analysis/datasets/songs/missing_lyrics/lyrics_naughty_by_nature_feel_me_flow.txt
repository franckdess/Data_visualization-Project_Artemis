You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin' dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys
Are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally
Then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

So here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over fixing's that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin' splittin' things that's bitten
And gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off
Before you even started, so what
So long, see you fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye?

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know where's the wetter flow
That's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in poo boo's
I thought you knew too, stone style is of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin'
Damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebraes
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang, bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up, get up
Get up your with up, souped up
Put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not zip up, you lip up, whip up
Hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We come back 'cause we heard
Hip Hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the seventies, find me
So we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops, the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty

Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
