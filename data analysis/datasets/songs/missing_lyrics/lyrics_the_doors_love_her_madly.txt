Don't ya love her madly?
Don't ya need her badly?
Don't ya love her ways?
Tell me what you say

Don't you love her madly?
Wanna be her daddy?
Don't ya love her face?
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door
Like she did one thousand times before?

Don't you love her ways?
Tell me what you say
Don't ya love her as she's walking out the door?

All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love

All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark

Yeah, don't you love her?
Don't you love her as she's walking out the door?

All your love
All your love
All your love

Yeah, all your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark

Don't you love her madly?
Well, don't ya love her madly?
Don't you love her madly?
