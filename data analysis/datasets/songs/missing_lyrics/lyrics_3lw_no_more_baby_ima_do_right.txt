I'm getting a lil' tired of your broken promises, promises
Lookin at your pager, seein' different numbers and numbers
Call you on your cell, you hangin with the fellas, the fellas
Hangin with my girls
You always gettin jealous 'n' jealous
I was wit you when you didn't have no dollas, no dollas
Hangin at the crib, chillin wit your mama, yo mama
Never fronted you
Never brought the drama, the drama
Now you flip the script
Playa please

No I'm not the one
(Say it again, say it again oh!)
No I'm not the one
You do or you don't!!!

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more, no more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't, can't
Be a man be a man, man
No more, no more baby I'ma do right

You treat me like a lady when you open doors 'n' doors
But then you wanna front when you're wit your boys, your boys
How you gonna play me when I bought your clothes, your clothes
The ones that you be wearin' when you wit your dogs, your dogs
I know you never thought that I would have the nerve, the nerve
To think about it more since you at the curb, the curb
Blowin' up my pager say you want a chance, a chance
Listen when I say it, playa please

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more, no more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't, can't
Be a man be a man, man
No more, no more baby I'ma do right, do right

No, I'm not the one
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
Baby I'ma do right

I just wanna know, what happened to our love?
We used to be best friends
Where did it go wrong?
When you gonna see how good it is with me
I'm tired and I'm through with all your....listen baby! (Yo, yo, yo)

A yo, you promised me Kate Spade
But that was last year
Boy in the eighth grade
And you ain't biggie, baby boy
So no, it ain't "One More Chance"
When your friends around, you don't wanna hold my hand
And now you see a girl stylin' and wildin' inside the mix
Hoppin' out the whips, the whips, the 5, the 6
Yes fly chrome, so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter, go call Tyrone (You do or you don't)

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't (No more, no more)
No more (No more, no more), baby I'ma do right (Do right)
You can or you can't, can't (Baby be a man yeah)
Be a man, be a man, man (Baby be a man yeah)
No more, no more baby I'ma do right, do right

No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, sing it again oh)
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
(I'm tired of hearin')
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
(Never again, never again no no)
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one hey)
Baby I'ma do right, do right
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(I can do bad all by myself)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the one)

You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more, (Yeah, yeah) no more baby I'ma do right
You can or you can't, can't (You can't)
Be a man be a man, man (Be a man, be a man)
No more, no more baby I'ma do right, do right
