(TIMBO!) Hey! (NE-YO!) Say what? (LOSO!) Hey! Hey!

I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better

You plus me, it equals better math
Your boy a good look but she my better half
I'm already bossin, already flossin
But why have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin
(You're-You're-You're-You're) You're keepin me on my A game
(With-With-With-With) Without havin the same name
(They-They-They-They-They) They might flame
(But-But-But-But) But shorty we burn it up
The sag and my swag, pep in my step
Daddy do the Gucci mami in Giuseppes
Guess it's a G thing whenever we swing
I'm a need Coretta Scott if I'm 'gon be King (Oooh)

I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better

First thing's first, I does what I do
But everything I am she's my improve
I'm already bossin, I'm already fly
But if I'm a star, she is the sky
(And-And-And) And when I feel like I'm on top
(She-She-She) She give me reason then I stop
(And-And-And-And-And) And though I'm hot
(To-To-To) Together we burn it up

The caked up cut, the cleaned up ice
The shorty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo, Batman and Robin
Whoever don't like it is that man's problem
(AND-AND-AND) And when I feel like I'm tired
(MA-MA-MA) Mami be takin me higher
(I'M-I'M-I'M-I'M-I'M) I'm on fire
(BUT-BUT-BUT) But shorty we burn it up

I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better

Cause on the side of every great man
You could find a woman like a soldier holdin him down

She treats me like a don, watches for the hit
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip
And baby girl you so major they should front page ya (Front page ya)
God bless the parents who made ya (Who made ya)
Middle finger anybody who hate the (Who hate the) way we burn it up

I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better

Yeah baby, them lames you playin with, they 'gon push you down
We tryin to compliment you you know, make you better
Top Notch Tim, Nice Look Ne-Yo, Livin Good Loso
They ask you how you doin now, tell 'em better than them
HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm a movement by myself (Oh!)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh!)
But baby you, you make me better

(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
