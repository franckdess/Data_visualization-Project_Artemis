I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
And there's nothing particularly wrong
It's a feeling I feel inside
When I woke up early this morning
It was staring me straight in my eyes
I've got love (love) on my mind (ooh)
I've got love (love) on my mind (ooh)
I've got love (love) on my mind (ooh)
When you touch me I can't resist
And you've touched me a thousand times
When I think of your tender kiss, ah
Then and there I start to unwind, ooh, in your arms
I like to be, yeah, caressing you gentle
And tenderly, oh, yeah, from sunrise to sunset
All through the day, I've been waiting for your return
And you know this is where I'll be
I can say to the world I've learned only you can satisfy me
Satisfy me, oh, you have made me so very happy
Oh Baby, Baby, (love) love, love, on my (on my mind), my, my, my mind
Love (love), love, on-- (on my mind) my mind
(Love) I've got love (on my mind) on my mind, yeah
(Love) It's a whole lot of love (on my mind), it's a whole lot of love, yes, it is
(Love) I can't hear ya, say it for me one more time
(Love) Oh, I like the way you say it, when you say it for me, yeah
(Love, love) Ooh, you know, it's like paradise, say it twice
(Love, love) Got a whole lot of love, whole lot of love for you, Baby, yeah
(Love) You know this thing, I got love, yeah
I've got (Love) on my mind (on my mind)
Oh (love) love, love on my mind (on my mind)
I've got, (love) I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got
(On my mind) love, love, love
(Love) I've got love on
(On my mind) my mind, yeah
Oh (love) yeah, oh, love, (on my mind)
Love, love, love, la, la....yeah
