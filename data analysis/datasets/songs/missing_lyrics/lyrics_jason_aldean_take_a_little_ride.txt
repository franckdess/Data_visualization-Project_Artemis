Been goin' 'round and 'round all day
Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town

Shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a little shiner bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost down in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that's a good night
Anyone from the Heartland is gonna understand
What I'm talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer you can play my radio

Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

Take a little ride with you
Take a little ride with you
I wanna take a little ride with you
