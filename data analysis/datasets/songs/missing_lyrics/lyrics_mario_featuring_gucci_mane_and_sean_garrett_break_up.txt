I love you, but I don't think I can love you anymore...

When I kiss you so good (Mario), why would you wanna break up?
(Gucci) When this loving is so good, why would you wanna break up?
(Sean Garrett, the Pen)
If I hit that so good, why would you wanna break up? (Gucci)
If the feeling is so good, why would you wanna break up?
(We goin' in)

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)

Now baby girl had dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I been fired
On to the next one - more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses: miss one next 15 one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin' (Burr)
Swag so stupid but the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smoking doja
Baby girl went A.W.O.L, she used to be my soldier

(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci?
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louie?
(Don't) Don't I make your earlobe freeze?
(Don't) Don't when I dive I dive deep?
I know I be (gone) I know I be (gone)
I know I be (flirting with them girls)
I know I be, say I be right back but take too long
I know I be, saying I be faithful but I don't
I know I be making you them promises then breaking your heart again
Telling you she wasn't who she was then we arguing
But ba-by.. I love, you - OHH!

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)

You might be from the hood, but to me you're a model
Everything I ever ever seen in a model
If you leaving baby don't leave me until tomorrow
Tonight we gonna get a little tipsy with a bottle
You gonna get me up, I'm gone take 'em down
I'm gone change my ways, we gon' work it out
Girl, I wouldn't be the same if you were with somebody else
Girl, it wouldn't be the same if I were with somebody else
I know, I made, mistakes, before
Promise, you won't, get hurt, no more
I got, what you, like and, you know
Once you lay down, it's on

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)

Why you wanna leave me, you should wanna tease me
Being icy ain't easy, I make it look easy
Used to cop you Bally, now you rock Louie
Now it's fuck shawty, I don't like Gucci
 2X
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you - when I'm, when I'm
Lovin' you, lovin' you; why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you (why would you wanna break up?)
See I be driving through your hood (why would you wanna break up?)

Now would you, break up, break up, break up? Yeah
I'm back, baby...
