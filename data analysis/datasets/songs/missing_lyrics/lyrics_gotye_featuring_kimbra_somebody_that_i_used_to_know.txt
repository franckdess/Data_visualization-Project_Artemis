But you didn't have to cut me off;
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low:
Have your friends collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
