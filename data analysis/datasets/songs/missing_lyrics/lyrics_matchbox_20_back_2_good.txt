It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there
I could say so much
But I don't go there because I don't want to
I was thinking if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about
Somebody else
Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how
To get it back to good

This don't mean that, you own me, well
This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted too
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try to give me some room
Oh, to figure out just what I'm going to do

Because everyone here, hates everyone here for doing
Just like they do
And It's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell, why everyone here was doing me like they do
But I'm sorry now, and I don't know how
To get it back to good
Everyone here, is wondering what it's like to be with
Somebody else
And everyone here's to blame, and everyone here
Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain, well everyone hides
Shades of shame, yeah but looking inside we're the same
We're the same
And we're all grown now, yeah, but we don't know how
To get it back to good

Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking 'bout
Somebody else
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But it's over now, yeah and I don't know how, because it's over now
There's no getting back to good
