Konvict
Konvict, Music, and you know we Upfront

I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know, girl

Money in the air as mo’ fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel
Ho sale; don’t tell, won't tell
Baby say “I don’t talk, Dogg unless you told on me” - oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon’ do
Baby stick to me and I’ma stick on you
If you pick me then I’ma pick on you
D-O double G and I’m here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and your’s is right
Rip ridin’ the poles and them doors is tight
And I’ma get me a shot ‘fo the end of the night
Cause pussy is pussy and baby you’re pussy for life

I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know, girl

Shorty, I can see you ain’t lonely
Handful of niggease and they all got cheese
See you lookin’ at me now what its gon’ be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin’ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it don’t mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know, girl

Mobbin' through the club and I’m low pressin’
I’m sittin’ in the back in the smoker’s section (just smokin’)
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can’t see me, but I can see you (baby I see you)
Hmm, it’s cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You’re rubbin’ your back and touchin’ your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin’ at me
Girl and while your lookin' at me I’m ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin’ to just give you everything and that’s kinda scary
Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don’t get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know, girl, girl
