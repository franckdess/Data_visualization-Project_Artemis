Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

I know you think I'm not
Your picture perfect jewel
Who'll never break apart
When everything was cool
I needed to explore
And open up the door
But now I need you more
Im sending out a message
A message so sincere
When I close my eyes
I need to feel you near
Can't get you off my mind
For leaving me this time
I'm still in love with you


If I had your attention
I'd tell you what I learned
Despite of good intentions
Its easy to get burned
I learned my lesson well
It's you I need to tell
This time Im all for you
I need for you to trust me
To give me all your best
I'll prove just what your love means
Just put me to the test
This time I need to stay
Don't need to go away
I'm still in love with you


You're my morning sun
You're my shining star
You're my number one
Cross my broken heart
In your eyes
I see
What you mean to me
You're my destiny

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
