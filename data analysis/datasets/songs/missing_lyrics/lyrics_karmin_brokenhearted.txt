Oh
Yeah yeah
Uh, come on
Yeah

This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touchin' me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow

In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow

Oh oh, yeah

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yep, and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right

Honest, baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time? Such a crime
Not a single word, sippin' on that Patr√≥n
Just to calm my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone

Oh yeah

Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, hold me up,
Baby I'm in doubt,
Oh oh, and I don't even think you know

No, no, no

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right

Honest, baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right, cheerio, hey

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you said it's like go with the view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was that outfit really whack?

This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Honest, baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right, do it, do it

When you gonna call
Don't leave me brokenhearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio, uh
