Listen girl you know my situation,
you know my problems and the shit that i'm facin'
i told you everything you need to know about the kid,
you kept it realer than my friends with the shit you did.
i got caught up, and i never talk up
i look at you and feel some way like baby pass some more cups
and then i'm drinking and yawning and sinking and falling
you know i like my milk in the morning, ha
but i thank yeah, always me and her
no matter what time you would always answer
for that, i should'a put some diamonds on a ring
fuck what anybody says you're a diamond in this ting

but i have to let you go
coz i don't wanna hurt no one no more
i'm sorry i cant do this no more
i don't wanna let you go
girl i really wanna be with you, wanna be real with you
i cant leave you alone
i know i'm in the wrong
but i have to let you go
you're the only one i want in my life
i wish i could make you my wife
i cant leave you alone
i know i'm living wrong
so i have to let you go

you were worried every time that i leave the crib
even more when its a pouch that i'm leaving with
you never knew if id make it back home and you sat there stressed keepin' your eyes on that phone,
got a million bitches, but they ain't you
you heard a few rumors, but they ain't true
i miss it when you get me mad
then i diss you then i kiss, then that feeling when you look up that you dissed me then i kiss, uh
we used to fri non stop
i make you cum then you get on top
we had some time ill never forget baby,
not a moment with you i regret baby

but i have to let you go
coz i don't wanna hurt no one no more
i'm sorry i cant do this no more
i don't wanna let you go

i cant leave you alone
i know i'm in the wrong
but i have to let you go
you're the only one i want in my life
i wish i could make you my wife
