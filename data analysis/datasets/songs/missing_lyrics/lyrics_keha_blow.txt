Dance

Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
(This place about to)
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out

This place about to blow (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Now what?  (What)
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
(This place about to)
Tonight we're takin' names, 'cause we don't mess around

Go-go-go-go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes

We are taking over
Get used to it, okay?
