Creep with Dr. Bullshit
When I talk my teeth should rot
I'm from Da Bricks, so which means I'm born to dog
Your girlfriends want a shot at it?
Warn 'em all
I hear them all from the bathroom stall
Tap and drawl
Say they get gas to pass platinum cars
Then I'm like, Yo!
I'm goin' to buy my crew bikes with double pipes
That we quick to lose on the turnpike
I'm the one that turned you out, dog it out
It was the Hennessy that made us slug it out
But you like, bitch you freaky, you down with it
Your other man's a punk
When I hand the punk the rush, he ride out
I'm tough, even Honey Comb hide out, duck the hour
Rush, better choose quick chick, I got tracks to dust
