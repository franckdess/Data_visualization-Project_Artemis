I'm so glad that I met you, baby
And I'm so proud
When we walk down the street
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do
But I get this feeling that I'm losing you
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it
But it gets me sometimes
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Ooh, suspicions
When I'm with you
I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side
And that look
You get in your eyes when we love
It makes me hate myself for what I'm thinking of
I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me
Ooh, suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way
