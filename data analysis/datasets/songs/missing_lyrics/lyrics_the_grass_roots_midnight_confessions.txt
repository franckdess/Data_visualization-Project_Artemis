{Instrumental Lead in}
The sound of your footsteps
Tellin' me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, babe
Brings out a need in me that no one can hear, except
In my midnight confession
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you
But a little gold ring you wear on your hand
Makes me understand
There's another before me
You'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time
{Hook}
Staggerin' through the daytime
Your image on my mind
Passin' so close beside you, babe
Sometimes the feelings are so hard to hide, but
In my midnight confession
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you
{Hook - horn section}
There's a little gold ring you wear on your hand
Makes me understand
There's another before me
You'll never be mine
I'm wastin' my time
In my midnight confession
When I'm tellin' the world that I love you
In my midnight confession
When I say all the things that I want to
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na, na-na...
