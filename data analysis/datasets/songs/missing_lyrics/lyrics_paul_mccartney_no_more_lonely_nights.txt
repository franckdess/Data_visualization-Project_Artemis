I can wait another day until I call you
Mm-hm
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything aflutter (na na na na)
But another lonely night might take forever (na na na na)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me love

Cause I know
What I feel
To be right

No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
(Na-na-na na)
Of being near you
(Na-na-na na-na na-na)
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter

I will do
What I feel
To be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away


Yes, I know
What I feel
To be right

No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
No more lonely nights
No, no
Hoo
