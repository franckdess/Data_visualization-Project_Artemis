There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candyland appears each time you smile (ooh ooh ooh)
Never thought that fairy tales came true
But they come true
When I'm near you

You're a genie in disguise (ooh ooh ooh)
Full of wonder and surprise
And

Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

If I could I'd catch a falling star
To shine on you so I'll know where you are (ooh ooh ooh)
Order rainbows in your favorite shade
To show I love you
Thinking of you

Write your name across the sky (ooh ooh ooh)
Anything you ask I'll try
'Cause

Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
