I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take a chance
And learn the way of love, my baby
And all that it had to offer
In time you will see that love won't let you down
You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
That I gave it half a chance
And learned the way of love my baby
There is so much love inside me
And all that I have I give my all to you
And all this love is waiting for you
And all, all my love is waiting for you
All this love is waiting for you
And baby all, baby all this love is waiting for you
Oh, I love how you make me feel this way
My love is getting stronger every day
And after all I went and put myself through
I found that all I really needed was you
As the sun has its place up in the sky
I love you so dearly
And all the same, there's no need to wonder why
I need you, please hear me
Say you really love me, baby
Say you really love me, darling
For I really love you baby
You know I really love you darling
Say you really love me, baby
Say you really love me, darling
For I really love you baby
Sure enough love you darling
Say, say you love me......
