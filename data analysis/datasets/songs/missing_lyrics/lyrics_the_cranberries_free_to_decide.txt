It's not worth anything more than this at all
I live as I choose or I will not live at all
So return to where you've come from
Return to where you dwell
Because harassment's not my forte
But you do it very well
I'm free to decide, I'm free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all
I'm free to decide, I'm free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all (at all, at all, at all)
You must have nothing more with your time to do
There's a war in Russia and Sarajevo, too
So to hell with what you're thinking
And to hell with your narrow mind
You're so distracted from the real thing
You should leave your life behind (behind)
Cause
I'm free to decide, I'm free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all
I'm free to decide, I'm free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all (at all, at all, at all)
I'm free to decide, I'm free to decide
And I'm not so suicidal after all (at all, at all, at all)
At all, At all, At all
