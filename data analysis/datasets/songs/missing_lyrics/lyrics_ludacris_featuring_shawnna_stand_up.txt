How you ain't gon' fuck?! Bitch, I'm me!
I'm the goddamn reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this

When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?

Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!

Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
When I move, you move, just like that?
Hell yeah, hey DJ bring that back

Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up!
