She grew up
With the children of the stars
In the Hollywood Hills and the boulevard
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks
Like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger
And Sonny and Cher
She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage
I can tell that
She can`t let go and she can`t relax
And just before
She hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby

Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye

She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street
About a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she`s so pretty
But she`d be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She`s seen her share of devils in this angel town

Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye

I told her
I ain`t so sure about this place
It`s hard to play a gig in this town
And keep a straight face
Seems like everybody`s got a plan
It`s kind of like Nashville with a tan

Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything`s gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything`s gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
