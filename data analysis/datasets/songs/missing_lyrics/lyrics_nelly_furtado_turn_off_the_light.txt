It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say "woe is me" instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me, "You're better off alone"

But after midnight, morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know, she act too tough tough tough
Well it's till' I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know, she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (By the moon)
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go

But after midnight, morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some

They say that girl ya know, she act too tough tough tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know, she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you come and be with me?
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Where is the love that I'm looking to find?
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me?

All in me yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
Do you see all my dreams? (Yeah)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
Follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Follow me down, follow me
Down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Do you see all my dreams?)
See all my dreams
Follow me follow me follow me
Down down down down
See all my dreams
See all my dreams

All in me yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Where can you turn?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
