It's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right
For a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurting song
About a love that's gone wrong
Cause I don't want to cry all alone
Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurting song
About a love that's gone wrong
Cause I don't want to cry all alone
Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
(Hey, won't you play)
Won't you play
Another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
(Hey, won't you play)
Won't you play
Another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
