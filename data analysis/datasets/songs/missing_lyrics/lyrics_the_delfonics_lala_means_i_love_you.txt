Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, baby please now
La la la la la la la la la means
I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me, (one for me)
Let me hold me in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see, (you will see)
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, baby baby
La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you, yes to you
Listen to me

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, you'll have to understand now
La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Come on and take my hand
La la la la la la la la la means
