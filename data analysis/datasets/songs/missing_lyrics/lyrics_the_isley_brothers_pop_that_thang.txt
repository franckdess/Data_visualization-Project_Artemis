Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)
Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)

Ting a ling a ling
I hook it on up
Get on down
Now do your stuff
Come on

Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)
Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)

If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Runnin' after that hen
Come on

Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)
Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)

Sister Rosaline
Ting a ling a ling
Look at that child
Popping that thang
Hitch up to my wagon
And get ready to roll
But don't get on board
If you can't carry the load
If balloon goes down
I fill it up with wind
If the record stops
Start it over again

Ow, pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)
Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)

Ting a ling a ling
Hook it on up
Get on down
Go on and do your own stuff

Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)
Pop that thang (Pop that thang)
Bang, bang, bang (Bang, bang, bang)

If you can't do it right
Don't try it again
Look at that rooster
Running after that hen
Come on and pop it
(Pop it, pop it, pop it)
Come on and pop it
(Pop it, pop it, pop it)
Come on and pop it
