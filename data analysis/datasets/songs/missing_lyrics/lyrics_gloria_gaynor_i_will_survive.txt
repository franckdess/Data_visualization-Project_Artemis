At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive
