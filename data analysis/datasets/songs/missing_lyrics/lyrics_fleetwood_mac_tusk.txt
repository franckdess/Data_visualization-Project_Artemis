Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?

Don't say that you love me, hiyee-ha
Just tell me that you want me, hiyee-ha
Tusk!
Just say that you want me, hiyee-ha
Don't say that you

Tusk!
Real savage-like
Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!
