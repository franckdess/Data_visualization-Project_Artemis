Go, go, go, go
(Turn the lights off)

Oh lover, don’t you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make momma proud
(Turn the lights off)

(And when we're done) I don’t wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby

You can’t stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there (you can do it, I believe in you, baby)
So close from here
Baby, I’mma be your motivation
(Uh-huh, yeah)
Go, go, go, go
Motivation
Go, go, go, go

Uh, girl I turn that thing into a rainforest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
Make, make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I’m her transportation
Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like I’m racing
When I’m done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby

(And when we're done) I don’t wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby

You can’t stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you’re almost there (you can do it, I believe in you, baby)
So close from here
Baby, I’mma be your motivation

Oh lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same, no
I won't let you get up out that game, no
So go lover, go 'n make me rain

(And when we're done) I don’t wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby

You can’t stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you’re almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here
Baby, I’mma be your motivation
