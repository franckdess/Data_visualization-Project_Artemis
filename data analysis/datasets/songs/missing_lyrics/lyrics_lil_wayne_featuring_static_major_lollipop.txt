No homo, Young Moolah baby

So I let her lick the rapper

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps

Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lying
Man, she ain't never had a move like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her to back it up like burp, burp
And made that ass jump like "jerp, jerp"

Shawty want a thug

Drop it shawty, drop it like its hot
Ooh, drop it like its hot
Do it shawty, don't stop
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't shit
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't this
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
But shawty, I'mma hit it, hit it like I can't miss
And "he can't do this", and "he don't do that!"
Shawty need a refund, need to bring that nigga back
Just like a refund, I make her bring that ass back
And she bring that ass back cause I like that

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps

She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick me like a lollipop

The middle of the bed, I'm giving/getting head
