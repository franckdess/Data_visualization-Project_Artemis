Whatever it is, it'll keep till the morning
Haven't we both got better things to do?
Midnight blue
Even the simple things become rough
Haven't we had enough?
And I think we can make it
One more time
If we try
One more time for all the old times
For all of the times you told me you need me
Needing me now is something I could use
Midnight blue
Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend?
Maybe it's not the end
And I think we can make it
One more time
If we try
One more time for all the old times
Midnight blue
I think we can make it
I think we can make it
Oh, wouldn't you give your heart to a friend?
Think of me as your friend
And I think we can make it
One more time
If we try
One more time for all of the old, old times
One more time
I think we can make it
If we try
I think we can make it
If we try
Looks like we're gonna make it
Looks like we're gonna make it
If we try
I think we can make it
