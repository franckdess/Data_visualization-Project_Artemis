Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya

We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody lives for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la

We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
We're the kids
We're the kids
We're the kids in America
