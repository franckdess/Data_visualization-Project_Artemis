{Intro}
I'm ridin' in your car, you turn on the radio
You're pullin' me close, I just say no
I say I don't like it, but you know I'm a liar
Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire
Late at night, you're takin' me home
You say you want to stay, I say I want to be alone
I say I don't love you, but you know I'm a liar
Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire
You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Well, your kisses they burn, but my heart stays cool...
{Pause}
Well, Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet a love they couldn't deny
My words say split, but my words they lie
Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire
{Bridge}
Oh fire
Kisses like fire...
Burn me up with fire
I like what you're doin now, fire
Touchin' me, fire
Touchin' me, burnin me, fire
Take me home
