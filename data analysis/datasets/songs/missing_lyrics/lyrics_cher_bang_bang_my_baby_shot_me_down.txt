Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, you shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called you mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang, you shot you down
Bang bang, and I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
