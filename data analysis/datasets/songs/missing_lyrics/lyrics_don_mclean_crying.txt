I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say 'hello'
And though you wished to me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been
Crying, over you
Crying, over you
Then you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying
I thought that I, was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more, than I did before
But, darling, what can I do
While you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying, over you
Crying, over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
(Crying)
Crying
(Crying)
Crying
(Crying)
Crying
Crying
Crying
Over you
