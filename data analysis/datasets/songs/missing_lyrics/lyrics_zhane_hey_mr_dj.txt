What we're gonna do now is go back

Everybody, move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)
Everybody, move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)

It's Friday night and the weekend's here
I need to unwind, where's the party, Mr. D.J
I am ready to call my friends
So we could all get down
Where's the party, hey Mr. D.J

Hey Mr. D.J. (You can get this started)
Everybody's ready to party (All night, all night)
All the girls are ready (So we can all get to it)
So we can party 'till the break of dawn, oh

Everybody, move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)
Everybody, move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)

It's Friday night and the weekend's here
I need to unwind, where's the party, Mr. D.J
I am ready to call my friends
So we could all get down
Where's the party, hey Mr. D.J

Hey Mr. D.J. (You can get this started)
Everybody's ready to party (All night, all night)
All the girls are ready (So we can all get to it)
So we can party 'till the break of dawn, oh

Once again, it's on, yo Zhan√© blow the horn
Let the D.J. know to keep playing your song
Maybe I'll browse, snatch up the blouse
Rip the foul, ho
And get rub-a-dub style
'Cause your body won't move
If it can't feel the groove
So can't boogie, have to show and prove
Hey, now I'm feeling the vibe
Rolling with the flavor
Feeling alright
Ho, yo, there's a party over here
Yo, oh no, the party's over there
Call up your friends, let 'em know
Fam's tagging along
Hey D.J. keep playing that song

Everybody, move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)
Everybody, move your body, now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move and groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on (on and on and on and on)
