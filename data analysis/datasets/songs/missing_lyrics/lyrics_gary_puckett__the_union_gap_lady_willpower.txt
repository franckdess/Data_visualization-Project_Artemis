Lady Willpower
It's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly
I know you want to see me
But you're afraid
Of what I might have on my mind
One thing you can be sure of
I'll take good care of your love
If you will let me give you mine
Lady Willpower
It's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly
Did no one ever tell you
The facts of life?
Well, there's so much you have to learn
And I would gladly teach you
If I could only reach you
And get your loving in return
Lady Willpower
It's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly
Lady Willpower
It's now or never
Give your love to me and
I'll shower your heart with tenderness
Endlessly
Lady
