Because the force
It’s got a lot of power
And it make me feel like ah

To my body now

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain’t nothing like a love desire (Ooh)

Like hot candle wax
Sensation (Oh sensation)
Lovely where we're at
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining (Aah)
Cause this is love power (Ooh)

Don't stop 'til you get enough
