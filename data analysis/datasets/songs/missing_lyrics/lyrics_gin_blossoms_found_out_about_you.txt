All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies
Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free
Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about
Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out
Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you
I found about you
