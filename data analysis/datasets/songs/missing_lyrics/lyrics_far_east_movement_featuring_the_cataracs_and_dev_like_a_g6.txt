Dev:
Poppin' bottles in the ice like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right, gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, in my ride like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Kev Nish:
Give me that Mo-Moët
Give me that Cris-Cristal
Ladies love my style, at my table, gettin' wild
Get them bottles poppin', we get that drip and that drop
Now, now give me two more bottles, 'cause you know it don't stop
The Cataracs:
(808) Hell, yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk

Proghess:
Sippin' on, sippin' on sizz, I'm 'a ma-make it fizz
Girl, I keep it gangsta, poppin' bottles at the crib
This is how we live every single night
Take that bottle to the head and let me see you fly

When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk

It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't touch this)
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up

Put your, put your hands up
Hell, yeah, make you put your hands up, make you put your hands up
Put your, put your hands up
