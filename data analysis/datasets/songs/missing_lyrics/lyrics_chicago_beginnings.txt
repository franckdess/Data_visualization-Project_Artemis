When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are
Or what we're doing, I'm with you, that's all that matters
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Mostly I'm silent mmm silent la la la la la
Never think about words to say

When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings
The color of chills all over my body
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words

Mostly I'm silent silent la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Silent

Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever yeah
Oh no whoa yes
Only the beginning, only just the start
I've got to get you into my life
Got to get you next to me
Only the beginning, only just the start

Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
