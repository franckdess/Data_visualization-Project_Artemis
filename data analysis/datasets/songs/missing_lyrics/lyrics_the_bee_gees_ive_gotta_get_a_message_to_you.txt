Y'all think JC is the fuckin' man, but he really a kid though
No games, I came with a classic 30 like the mini Nintendo
Yeah, you catch a Klitschko, right into the big show
I lay down the law, when JC black out it ain't Jim Crow
I'm down ten toe, two guns, a Kimbo
30 shot, he duckin' a pole, stuck in limbo
Come get your shit smoked, semi will murk kinfolk
JC will stain the glass...in church windows
Now what's the popular vote? Ya throwin' rocks at the GOAT
Who traded yacht for a boat?
What's a lot to the most?
Wait? You violate I get him shot in the throat
So if you trip, he'll eat a clip like he swallowed a roach
Look, I bang mine from the waist line with no answers
I'm a straight timer you a programmer
I'm in the jets with the TECs by the clothes hamper
You buzzin' for talkin' out ya neck, that's throat cancer
Look, I rock for delph, big dawg of the common wealth
Head first in that dirt, how an ostrich felt
All I need is a lil' blade and a Glock for help
I got the knife 'n the toaster, I'm 'bout to shock myself!
Get the belt, who want a piece? Y'all gon' get it, one a piece
If him up he get hemmed up, cuffed and creased
You act hard on stage, you'se a fuckin' geek
I brought bars by the waves that's Muscle Beach
I'm a beast, this the prey, but squares think he got the sauce, in a fish filet
I wore that time like a man, not shit to say
I couldn't tell on Death Row like I was Michel'le
Now get your arms to the ceilin' when I lift the K
You rap for the cam', these bombs in the buildin'; Tim McVeigh
I duff your fiancee on Christmas Day
Fuck what he be on, say, (Beyonce) I carry twins for J(ay)
I say look, you in the way, shots ring, they gon' call a SWAT team
We keep a street sweeper to leave the block clean
Yeah that mop thing, stashed by the box spring
With the drum I lay him flat, pick a hot wing
I said he will not swing, he takin' it to the dome
There's paper that's on the phone got me breakin' another zone
I bury you in the yard, scrapin' you to the bone
In your driveway with the shovel like the neighbor from Home Alone
I'm grown, you just as funny as you look
You ain't never had to kick a door with a skully on your foot
Dirty AK, I'm goin' dummy on the jooks
I'm 'bout to make JPay, I got some money on the books
I said he shook, if it's war than you get a halo
Scorpion on the Kato
This D.E. 40 ain't in Vallejo
Twistin' Harry Potter my main hoe
Lay low with a Draco
Killer Instinct I'ma sender wherever J go (Jago)
Ayo, if I was in crowd I'd hit you wit a tomato
And it's grocery bags at every battle so don't get fuckin' crazy
You are not big enough for the body bag, you are just a baby
Look alive squirt

Absolutely nothin' bring me to you
But I still gotta kill you, easily too
Why?
Somethin' about this flow you just can't expose
I won't even make it close, they say gotta be pilled up to try to stop me
So on first take they poppin' Molly like they Jaylin Rose
I got an accurate shot
So strap up, like when cool niggas passin' the cops
Cause every gun got a name
And judgin' from this Gun Title ain't gon' be no "after the shot"
It's these niggas that shit on battle rap the moment they ain't capable of showin' anything new
You know the niggas that battle rap but they not battle rappers cause the shit corny?
Yeah I know, it makes sense to me too
I didn't change the clip, I changed the gun, everything I'm dishin' new (additional)
We could be acres apart, they still gon' find a place in your heart, nigga they unconditional
These are not threats, ain't no need to talk about it
Shit he can't even see the rays bitch I'm ultraviolet
And bein' in front of this bus', shit not even Rosa Parks will try it
You're makin' history, shit I make niggas great when they go through the hoops, including you
I'm the only one of these niggas that actually give credit for losin' to
But you gotta fight, I mean many niggas have lost on this road, but only a few found it
Too many playin' the numbers game, worried about the view countin'
And who's countin', til they at they wake, and it ain't you countin'
I mean the shit is sad, I thought he took a break, you know flip a bag
But the fans don't even ask about him, I thought the shit was really sad
Though not really
It's still fans on them Norfolk streets, they just switched to Ave
And I know you sick of hearin' that, but you gotta clear it though
Take care of home, and when you do, break a leg, tear the bone; Derrick Rose
Cause at this point, you done and you can only get washed once like generic clothes
You in a brawl for your health, you gon' need all of they help
Cause you dealin' with hecklers, this gon' look like when Prep pausin' himself
Though I'm devilish, you-y'all remember me, spittin' crack like Snoop in a wheelchair?
You wanna know what else stem from that thought?
He chokin' and gettin' exposed tryin' to get rid of Raw
Same scenario, right?
But that scope got a lens wide enough to keep every nigga on yo' field watchin'
I send a paid shooter, he will pop
And you gon' only see him once like Will pops
I'm involved with the hammer next to me
I won't even let a nigga affect my sleep
He'll get that extra sleep, I even call it my rest in peace (restin' piece)
Nigga it's never safe, that weapon raised, mind, body and soul segregate
Blastin', the clips only compliment the ratchets so you gon' hate when you see 'em, they like weddin' tapes
I know what hood he go in cause that's the hood I stroll in
Need I remind you? That machine behind you ain't good promotion
They know when I'm stormin' just by how calm I approach
That fire work, like Jason Pierre Paul wit it though
Cause now I'm forever armed wit the fo'
It's body bags at every battle, make sure your homie found one
But do not-you know the rest nigga, let's go

I'm dope, sick, I think I need some boxin'
It's 'bout time for a rebuttal for them dreams you droppin'
You said I shit on battle rap? That's cause fiends is coppin'
But I ain't never shit on battle rap, that ain't even really True, like them jeans you rockin'
I'll ruin ya dude's life for them dead presidents
Get chewed you lose stripes, y'all wet peppermint
You got back on Smack and really set precidence
They gave you a legend, I heard you got to battle Chef Trez and shit
Damn, you killin' it man
Ever since he wasn't able to pay rent
He did a 100 battles and made a thousand dollars and eight cents
If y'all tryin' to get me on the card it take chips
Or get a one rounder out this fraud for baked fish
Cake mix, steak tips, a zip
He battles nobodies, shoot shots you can't miss
What I'm sayin' is, y'all rate him a great, it don't make sense
Just cause he Rap-A-Lot don't crown J Prince
Take this, exclusivity make your bread last
Fuck ya pen game, believability you dead last
What I'm cookin', even the trailer blowin' up that's a meth lab
ARP set the J up, this a chest pass
This as easy as a layup off the fresh glass
I'm Russian soldiers in the field like a Spetsnaz
I send his heart to the house of his bride, Fed Ex fast
But then his head, a couple hours behind like jet lag
Get dragged, I circle ya block, dome check him
I had to put in work on my ock with no weapon
If we was in the cell I'd beat him and phone check him
Knife in his ass, blood will have a shittier stream than NOME 7
I'm a road legend, cold flexin', state to state on ya
You gon' need a grenade launcher and some face armor
Find your location and lay on it then bang on ya
Gun with a bayonet, I put the Blade on it like a Daywalker
I hate all of the fake fraud and the raps they say to ya
I'll crack his head like a macadamia
Snap his trachea, it's too flooded in the ring, this shit Wrestlemania
I'm in a Rolls Royce whippin' a Ghost it's Castlevania
Video game bars, what's that? Nerd shit
Boy that ain't nothin' but truth
If I say somethin' 'bout 2K y'all gon' jump through the roof
Right? Right
Bunch of selective criticism all comin' from fruits
That hear Friday punchlines and cum on they boots
"Aw Craig shop somethin' somethin' head shot oooh my God"
I say look, I'm in VA sittin' low on a three day give and go
Where fiends tryin' to trade a dime of that sweet thing
For a key chain and a pee stained Vizio
All I got is gun bars cause I let my heat bang really though
Bunch of 40's in my crib, it's like the G Thang video
Here we go, ya flow? Give it 2 outta 10
Cause y'all get burnt by Smack, crawl back and let him screw y'all again
They tried to cut my hands off and I grew out a limb
I was never scared to burn a bridge cause I knew how to swim
And it's grocery bags at every battle so don't get fuckin' crazy
You are not big enough for the body bag, you a just a baby

That last round was a problem witchu
I gotta be honest witchu
It's them four bar set ups, four bars that are not official
You use the four bar set up for, "upper cut 'em through the roof like it's Mortal Kombat"...fuckin' garbage
But aye, JC battled in garages, niggas love startin'
You was in them fuckin' garages too nigga, and you wasn't parkin'
See these niggas love showin' out on camera, only on set they thuggin', just extra buggin'
All that actin' gon' get your man bodied by the can, not the Oscar you was expectin' was it?
It's not like we've been rivals, but that pen title, I'll kill for it
Populated the Pearly Gates with speed  that keep the .38's on a spin cycle
And I'm still spittin' and the shots heat you
But like a hot single, you gotta deal wit it
So which team we servin'
The niggas that fill up they rap sheet braggin' 'bout they rap sheet
Armed robbery, wow, a thievin' person
Kick doors, you happy cause you got caught jackin', so did Pee Wee Herman
The shit don't even sound  but this shit different y'all
It can flip a car faster than a crowd riot
So I gotta hold it down and keep the crowd silent
Then the rounds flyin'
And fuck how you feel, I'm the first man sprayin'
"K" and "respect" don't even go together, not even if Birdman say it
I don't have to ask him to stop, there's a whole society passin' for props
The automatics I got will make the bitch jump out faster than Kennedy car after the shot
I can guarantee my hood worse
At home K would've got found in a dumpster
Half the body hangin' out like one of Suge's shirts
Nigga he can be the first to get served
But that's if the bars don't murder him first
There's too much crack in this pad, every round I hustle, from the first to the third
And I am all with the shits
All that actin' belong with the clips
See they try to shoot like me but none of 'em accurate
It's like that government trackin', that shit all in the wrist
I know they could've taken the first shot to at least be remembered, but that shit all in the risk
I mean who gon' respect it?
I mean he too busy tryin' to convince y'all that he yo' complexion
Egghead nigga damn near got a yolk complexion
Back to battle rap, my habitat, where none of y'all can stop me
And everything after there's a carbon copy
Oh I own that, that chrome clap, what's on my side kick like my partner got me
We can make sure the casket's closed and he can take that act on the road
Cause only one person saw the body
Take care of them feelings first cause dealin' in feelings (fillings) hurts
Especially around us
You can end up losin' DNA and then you get this (dentist) work
Regardless if niggas feel me, can't no nigga kill me
I got a Gothic flow K, Guantanamo Bay, nigga the pen' is filthy
And I'm good with the pump
I can show y'all how a death stare really look when he slumped
I'm what's poppin' right now, them facades? Just hospital gowns
Soon as you check 'em, they all gotta put on a front
Now I know niggas don't wanna hear where Rich Dollaz at and that's cool
No disrespect to dude
But I'm the one who sent him there my nigga and he expectin' you
Round 2

I talk about your jeans, now I gotta talk about this shit
You lookin' real bummy for it
How your shirt got 20 dollars it and he ain't even pay $20 for it?
I touch down in NY, I got a quarter of sour
I hit the pedal and broke out like a poisonous flower
I got to the telly with ARP, he told JC, "Meet the boys in an hour."
You was upstairs in your room, puttin' toys in the shower
With that mini chest it's skinny pathetic, small physique
That says you need a booster step for your barber seat
Rappin', like you clappin' hand held monster heat
Nah, you need ya hand held 'cross the street
Because if J walkin', what he talkin', tell him talk to me
I've been the cause of grief for puttin' y'all to sleep
Throw me in the deep end, I'm killin' sharks to eat
You'll drown in the water...of Dawson's Creek
Peep, they ask me, "Where you been?" I don't like to blog
I'd rather smack you in your chin with a viking log
You micro soft I'm Zeus with lightening rod
I let you throw a punch and hit J(ay) with a Silent Bob
I say, "Who's nice as dawg?" You? He had to get a shot
Ain't no way he got the belt, all his jeans got elastic at the top
I done sold fake fish, had the tilapia to spot
Lost all the clientele, but I had to get the gwap
This shot, you roof will shatter
You small I send a deuce-deuce at ya
Put this pussy on a plate, I made a pupu platter
While you was playing Checkers, Connect 4, Life, Trouble, Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders
I had to check a connect for life, havin' trouble gettin' that can' to land, shootin' Ladders!
Gruesome matters, but I heard you had a son my brother, god bless, amazin' grace
I hope you raise him to be a man and not a waste of space
But just know the day gon' come where he try you, and break ya face
Judgin' by how you built, it'll be the age of eight
See it's hard to believe you lettin' sparks fly, dude wildin'
Not built like Smart Guy in 2000
I split ya melon with a banana make a fruit salad
Or throw you in the sleeper and snap my weight on your vocals like I knew Khalid
I'm too violent, free my dawg, pushin' through the courts
Cause the cops hit the door and put him through porch
The last spot got hot, we never knew the source
It had me in a hole, I had to leave over the pigs like Kalua pork
Luau's in Hawaii at a new resort
I don't expect you to catch that cause you dork
I be ridin' in limousines, the newest Porsche
You be survivin' on Kid Cuisines and usin' sporks
Be humble, or eat knuckle and scream "uncle"
I ain't comin' here to son you, I came to Capri Sun you
You little weak piece of shit, you would die if a bee stung you
When you walk past the middle school they mean mug you
But let you tell it, you palm a chopper and let it blow
You ain't even as tall as a chopper from head to toe
Braggin' 'bout yo' pen game, that's some shit I will never know
That's like fans sayin', "Yeah he lyin'. He's definitely lyin'...but the way he said it though..."
Let it go, I mix pain, dope and aggy
Why don't you take your pen game to the bowlin' alley
I served fiends with syringes on the floor, open baggies
They was fightin' over the pipe before North Dakota rallies
I said dope around me, I was thuggin' you wit the dick suckers
I almost lost a finger fuckin' wit the fence cutters
You was in Facebook chump groups, talkin' punches and your pen number
I was upstate, jump suit, punchin' in a pen number
And all these fans who say dude live and I hate you guys
Just know if the shoe fits, I bet it's grade school size
Because it is grocery bags at every battle
Now don't get fuckin' crazy
You are not big enough for a body bag, you are just a baby

Alright, picture this
Sike, this is exactly the round I go and kill
Never mind the time keepers, Bob Viola, dealer with holmes nigga you know the drills
He left stiff with a hole in him
Go get him! The shit open still
Of course he got rocked wit the beam
The first person shot on the scene like Cloverfield
I had to switch my whole style for this shit
So now I stalk the target when I aim the lead and I only aim for heads
Shit I be waitin' wit the Magnum like Mike under Stacey bed
Bitch I'm there til the job done
And job one? Slaughter one of his kids
And we ain't there til the body hit the river, I'm talkin' water under a bridge
And for real niggas, this shit easily felt
John Witherspoon on the Wayans how I reach for the belt
I just do it different
This for all the niggas who heard me rap and actually caught all the jewels I've givin'
For the niggas who heard punch with force and force yo' punch and actually knew the difference
For those who find that I reach, I'm just way outta they reach
In a league by myself
I mean you snap but you not allowed enough to let that demon be felt
I mean you slaughtered legends on King Of The Dot, so how come you ain't get a ring for the belt?
Ah nah, cause it's not a perk
See he put in work but that shit was seasonal help
Now which one of y'all thought I was gon' leave this bitch without a body
Just know, I believe in myself, that experience is out of body
But now I'm back to smoke somebody that wasn't on my radar at first
See how my attack got a lot of niggas mistaken
That means I got a method in schoolin' like How High
But so I'm diggin' old plots to get them Franklins
I'm talkin' big coffins, Sig sparkin', lead pourin' like Flint faucets
I'm the best period, I look deep in niggas souls, then I leave with niggas souls
Dealt a lot of pain with the kind of reign (Rain) not even Beasley can control
Heaven's waitin', then the nine get flashed
I tell 'em, "Catch 'em in traffic" but watch for the white man walkin'
See they know that's the sign you passed
The complexity of my rounds? It make them bitches a wreckin' ball
I know I may lose niggas sometimes but I stay in debt for y'all
I could easily drop Pokemon shit every round, but it ain't my message y'all
Just know, a lot of monsters come out of these rounds, you just gotta catch 'em all
One shot, I'm blastin', the gun shot collapsed him
They know it all til they run into me
Then they just end up unconscious rappers
Nigga I'm back snappin', of course I got the flow
Can't deny the flow, when I explode
You can't stop the fire with a flapjacket
They thought he was strapped for this schoolin' til he got sent back packin'
I need comp' you know, and even though the Glow, this Sho' Nuff gon' be the Last Dragon
So K, it is over wit
Overdose from the dopest pen, y'all know I wrote the shit
Every battle turns into a eulogy, my consolences
