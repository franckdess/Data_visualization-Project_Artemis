Always and forever, each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and
Everyday, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me, you really care
And we'll share tomorrow, together
I'll always love you forever, forever
There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
It's something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely, phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and
Everyday, love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me, you really care
And we'll share tomorrow, together
I'll always love you ever, ever
Always forever love you
Always forever love you
Always forever love you
Always forever love you
Always forever love you
I said forever, ever love you
Love you forever, ever
Always forever love you, you
Forever
