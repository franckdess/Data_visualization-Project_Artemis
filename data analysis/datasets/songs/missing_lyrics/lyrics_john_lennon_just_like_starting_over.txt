Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere...
Starting over
