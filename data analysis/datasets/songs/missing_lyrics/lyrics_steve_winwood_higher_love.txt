{Intro}
{Verse 1}
Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine
{Pre-Chorus}
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
{Chorus}
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
{Verse 2}
Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
{Pre-Chorus}
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
{Chorus}
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
A good kind of love, want a higher love
{Bridge}
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
Bring it, oh
{Instrumental Bridge}
I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be
Oh
{Instrumental Bridge 2}
{Chorus}
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
{Outro}
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh bring me
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh I said bring me
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
