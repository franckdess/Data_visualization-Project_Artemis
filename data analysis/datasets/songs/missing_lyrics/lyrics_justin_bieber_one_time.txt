When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountain top

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right

And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)

Your love's so deep
You know that it humbles me
You're by my side
Them troubles, them not trouble me
Many have called, but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty, I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt, I'm not right

And girl, you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time (Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy, you'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
