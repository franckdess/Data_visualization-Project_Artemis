Wish on a rainbow
Is all I can do
Dream of the good times
That we never knew
No late nights alone in your arms
I'll dream on
Living in wonder
Thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
You're so young is all they can say
They don't know
If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within

Watching the others
Chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside
I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart
Thinking in silence
Is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found
All these dreams one day will be mine
They cross my mind
My time has yet to come
Until then

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
Ooh, yeah

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us
If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
