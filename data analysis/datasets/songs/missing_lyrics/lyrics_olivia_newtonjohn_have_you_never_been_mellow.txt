There was a time
When I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day
When I just had to tell my point of view
I was like you
Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
To find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy
Just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?
Running around as you do
With your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back
Kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you
Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand, hey
Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
To find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy
Just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?
