Sent from heaven
Sent from heaven

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away (When love)
And you can't help who you love (Just can't help who you love)
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven) (Ooh, 'cause)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven)

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been
Notice when you change
When you don't feel as good as you used to before
And everything you used to say
Everything you used to do clear right out the door

Ooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, 'cause I wanna be, hey yeah

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Ooh, sent from heaven, yeah)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven) (I wanna be the one)
I wanna be the one who you believe (Hey!)
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Oh)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone (Yeah)
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven)

And everybody say I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be the one you love (Sent from heaven)
Everybody say I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be the one you trust (Sent from heaven)
Everybody say I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be the one you need (Sent from heaven)
Hey, everybody say I wanna be the one who...
I wanna be the one (Sent from heaven)
Sent from heaven!

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Hey, sent from heaven, yeah)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven) (I wanna be the one)
I wanna be the one who you believe (Oh)
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Hey)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven)

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven)
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (Sent from heaven)
