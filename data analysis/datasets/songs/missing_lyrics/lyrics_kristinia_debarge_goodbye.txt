Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going?
Am I supposed to be torn apart
Broken-hearted in a corner crying?
Pardon me if I don't show it

I don't care if I never see you again (No, no)
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and
Get yourself together
But either way, baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it
I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and
Just in case you're wondering
I've got that new "I'm a single girl" swag
Got me with my girls
And we're singing it, sing!

Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye (Goodbye)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye (Goodbye)

Cut my hair 'cause it reminded me of you
I know you like the long 'do
Had to switch my attitude up (oh)
Thinking of changing up how I ride
No more on the passenger's side
Too bad you missed out on the way that I drive it

I don't care if I never see you again (No, no)
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and
Get yourself together
But either way, baby, I'm gone, oh

I'm so over it
I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers
And just in case you're wondering
I've got that new "I'm a single girl" swag
Got me with my girls
And we're singing it, sing!

Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye (Goodbye)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye (Goodbye)

Hey, he-ey
Hey, he-ey
Hey, he-ey
Goodbye

I'm so over it
I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers
And just in case you're wondering
I've got that new "I'm a single girl" swag
Got me with my girls
And we're singing it, sing!

Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Na-na-na-na (Hey)
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye
