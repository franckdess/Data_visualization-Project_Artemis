Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs to someone else

Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue

Don't you remember the day
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely, prayed for you only
My love

Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue

Oooh, oooh. ooh
(Music)

Don't you remember the day
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely, cried for you only
My love

Why should I keep loving you?
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
When you're the blame for making me blue
