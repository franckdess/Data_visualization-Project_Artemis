Saturday morning, jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you

Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man
Yeah, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die
"Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family

Why you gotta be so rude?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
I can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be boys
Standing at that altar

Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die
"Tough luck my friend 'cause the answer's still no!"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family

Why you gotta be so rude?

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die
"Tough luck my friend but no still means no!"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
No matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family

Why you gotta be so rude?
Why you gotta be so rude? Why?
Why you gotta be so rude?
