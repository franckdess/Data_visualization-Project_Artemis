Now you can call me tip drill, they playin my songs
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, call it purp by the zone
Now she pussy poppin, yeah it's goin down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her get another round
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh Force Ones, Sean John buttoned down
And then I'm like, "Ohh, boy, my click full of stars"
Big fo'-fifth, big dick and big cars
At the end of the day when it's all said and done
I'mma need fo' freaks, cause I need more than one
