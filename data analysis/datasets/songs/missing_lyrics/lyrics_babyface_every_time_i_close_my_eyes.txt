Girl, it's been a long, long time comin', yes it has
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait, yeah

Yeah
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up its gates for me and you, yeah

And every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you, yeah (That I've got you)
And you've got me too (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true, yeah
That someone like you loves me too, yeah
Ay, yeah, yeah baby, yeah

Ooh ooh girl, I think that you're truly somethin', yes you are, yes
And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true, yes you are, yes

With you baby, (With you baby) it never rains and it's no wonder
The sun always shines when I'm near you
It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you, ooh oh

And every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you, yeah (That I've got you)
And you've got me too, baby (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself cause
I don't believe it's true, yeah (Oh baby)
That someone like you loves me too

To think of all the nights, I've cried myself to sleep, yeah
You really oughta know how much you mean to me (It's only right)
It's only right (You in my life) that you be in my life
Right here with me, oh baby, baby yeah, yeah


I tell you girl every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you, baby
And you've got me too baby (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause

That someone like you loves me too
