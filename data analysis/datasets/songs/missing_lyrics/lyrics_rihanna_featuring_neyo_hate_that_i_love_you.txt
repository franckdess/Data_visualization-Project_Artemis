Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (Yeah)
That's how much I need you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Oh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (Oh)

You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

And I hate how much I love you, girl (Ooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (Yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go (Ooh)
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's how much I love you
How much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you
I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ooh)
And I hate that I love you so, so
