Hey, Carrie Anne
Hey, Carrie Anne
When we were at school, our games were simple
I played the janitor, you played a monitor
Then you played with older boys and prefects
What's the attraction in what they're doing?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
You were always something special to me
Quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were aging
Where is your magic disappearing?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
You're so, so like a woman to me (So like a woman to me)
So, so like a woman to me (So, so like a woman to me)
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
People live and learn but you're still learning
You use my mind and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over, you'll be with me
Then I'll hear the other people saying
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play?
Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne
