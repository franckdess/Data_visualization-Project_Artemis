You always make me smile
When I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe
It's totally bonafide, mmm

It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch, it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
Ooh, oh, baby

Ooh, I want you to understand
How I feel, yeah, deep inside
Oh-ho, you make me feel
What I need to feel, yes
In my heart

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch, it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
Ooh, oh, baby


Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch, it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
Ooh, oh, baby (Your love, it feels so good)
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch, it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
Ooh, oh, baby (Your love, it feels so good)
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch, it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
Ooh, oh, baby
