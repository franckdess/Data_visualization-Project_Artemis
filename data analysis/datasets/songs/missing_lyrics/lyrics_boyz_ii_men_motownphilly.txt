Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat (nah)
While cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat

Back in school
We used to dream about this every day
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Boyzâ€”Boyz
Yo, these four new jacks is real
Smooth on the harmony tip
Nate, Mike, Shawn, and Wan
You know the mentality
Keep flippin' the gift

The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
Da da, daaa da da, da da da da da da
Live and direct from Phillytown
Rap and hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we were

Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen? Or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing, and they said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth

Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing
They came up to me, I said, "Well, what's your name?
(Boyz II Men!) Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Then I said, "Alright fellas
Well, let me see what you can do"
And then, with a smile, Wanya said
"Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you"

Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da
Da di da di da da, da da, daa daa oh
Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da
Da di da di da da, da da, daa daa oh

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Boyz, Boyz, Boyz
