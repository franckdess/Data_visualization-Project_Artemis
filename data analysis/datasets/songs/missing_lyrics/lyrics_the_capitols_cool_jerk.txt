We know a cat who can really do the cool jerk
We know a cat who can really do the cool jerk
Well, this cat they're talkin' about, I wonder who could it be
'Cause I know that I'm the heaviest cat
The heaviest cat you ever did see
When they see me walkin' down the street, (Hey, hey, hey.)
When the fellas want to speak, (Hey, hey, hey.)
On their faces, they wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know I'm the king of a cool jerk.  Whoooo!
Cool jerk
Cool jerk
(Cool jerk.  Uh huh.) Ha, ha, ha!
Look at them guys lookin' at me like I'm a fool
But ahhh, deep down inside, they know I'm cool
I said now, I said now the moment of truth has finally come when I have to show you some, some of that cool jerk
Now give me a little bit of drums by himself there
(Drums playing)
Now give me a little bass with those 88's
(Piano and bass guitar playing)
Awwww, you're cookin', baby!
Mmmm, you're smokin'!
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm
Now everybody, I wanna hear you all
Ahhh, can you do it?  Can you do it?
Can you do it?  Can you do it?
Can you do it?  Can you do it?
Can you do it?  Can you do the cool jerk?
Come on, people
(Cool jerk.) Hey, hey
When they see me walkin' down the street, (Hey, hey, hey.)
They think twice and then they speak.  (Hey, hey, hey.)
On their faces, they know why to smirk
'Cause they know I'm the king of a cool jerk.  Whoooo!
Cool jerk

(Cool jerk.) Can you do it now?
