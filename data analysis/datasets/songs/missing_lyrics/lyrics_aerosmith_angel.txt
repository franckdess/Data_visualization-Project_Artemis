I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears, and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love - let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough - I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Don't know what I'm going to do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true - loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love - I'm nothing but a begger
Without your love - a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
