Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter cause it's Tic-Tac--Toe
Now I'm a little bit older
I like to play just a little bit bolder
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders
I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin' like Jello
I like to speak cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way

X, and O. As in yes, and no
X, and O. As in sex, maybe so
X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex or maybe so
You might get some if you play this game
All girls love it but smooth is their game

That's why they just walk right by
Laughin', gigglin', shakin' that pie
Girls are what you what when you come up to them
So don't play dumb and try to school em
That's when you got to be real cool
Jump in the biz and act a fool
Pull out the portable car phone
Next thing you know you'll be drivin' em home
On the way there you're thinkin' bout one thing
Girls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing
You through the X and go for the kiss
They throw the O and go for the dis


Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?


I met this girl by the name of Judy
Kind of cute with a real nice booty
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the biz that week
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat
Went to my house and made the bed squeak
Yeah that Judy puts up a fight
But I won with the X cause I rolled that night
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood
My dad got up cause he heard some knockin'
Thought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'
Came to my room opened up the door
Son whatcha doin'?
Playin Tic-Tac-Toe
