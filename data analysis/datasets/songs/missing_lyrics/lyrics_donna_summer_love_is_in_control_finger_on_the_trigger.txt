:
I've hung around with big shots
Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire
But I know
Since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's getting ready to explode
There's been a change inside my life
And I just wanna let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't letting go
Baby, let's have some fun
A won't you be my
My number one

Mama used to tell me
Girl, you better load your gun up right
She said you
You gotta come out smoking
Hit it with your best shot
Every time
Well, I didn't understand her
Til you walked right into range
I saw your love at twenty paces
And I knew I'd won the game
You better raise your heart up high
Or love will blow you right away


Leave off that safety catch
There ain't no risk
We're gonna have some fun
I've got you
Love's begun
So stay with me until the morning sun
You're superbullet number one
Baby, let's have some fun
A won't you be my
My number one
There's been a change
Inside my life
And I just wanna let you know
