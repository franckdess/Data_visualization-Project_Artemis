We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
I said nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun
Fee fie, fo fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun

Better make a move now (Well, well)
You know there ain't no time to lose now
Oh, well, his fingers on the trigger, he's waiting to deliver
Can we ever figure out a way to make the people shout?

Fee fie, fo fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run
We've gotta make the stand against the devil's gun

Find a new direction (Well, well, well)
Another resurrection (Well, now)
Don't wait, hesitate or it's gonna be too late
Flames are getting higher, got to jump out of the fire!

He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we'll learn, one day we'll learn

Fee fie, fo fum
We're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run

Against the devil's gun

Find a new direction (Well, well, well)
Another resurrection (Well, now)
Don't wait, hesitate or it's gonna be too late
Flames are getting higher, got to jump out of the fire!

He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we'll learn, one day we'll learn
