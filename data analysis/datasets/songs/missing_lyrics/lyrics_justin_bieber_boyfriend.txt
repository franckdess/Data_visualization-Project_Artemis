If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

Tell me what you like, yeah, tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t never wanna fight, yeah, you already know
I‘ma make you shine bright, like you’re laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the-the-the world ends
Make you dance, do a spin, and a twirl, and
Voice goin' crazy on this hook, like a whirl wind
Swaggy

I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

So give me a chance, ‘cause you’re all I need, girl
Spend a week with your boy, I’ll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man (If I was your man), I’d never leave you, girl
I just wanna love and treat you right

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (Oh yeah)
Keep you on my arm, girl, you’d never be alone (Never be alone)
And I could be a gentleman (A gentleman, ooh), anything you want
