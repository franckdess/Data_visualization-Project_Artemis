What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I stand in line
One of a million admiring eyes
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real
Should I write or call your home
Shout it out with a megaphone
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way to get the message to you
Say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine
I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode
I've been around the block enough to know
This time I know it's for real
Ooo, baby
This time, this time......
This time, this time......
Ooo, baby
This time, this time......
Ooo, baby
Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real
I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode, oh baby
I've been around the block enough to know
This time I know it's for real
