Oh, baby baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom, is she smoking up outside? (Oh!)
Oh, baby baby, does she take a piece of lime for the drink that I'mma buy her?
Do you know just what she likes? (Oh!)

Oh-oh
Tell me, have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so, oh
I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home?
Ha-ha-he-he-ha-ha-ho

Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me
But can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy

(Love me, hate me)
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when, and now they're closing up the club (Oh!)
I've seen her once or twice before, she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way (Oh!)

Oh-oh
Tell me, have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so, oh
I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can somebody take me home?
Ha-ha-he-he-ha-ha-ho

Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me
But can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to, if you seek Amy

(Love me, hate me) Oh, say what you want about me
Oh, but can't you see what I see?
(Love me, hate me) Oh, say what you want about me
('Bout me, 'bout me)

So tell me if you see her
(Let me know what she was wearing, and what she was like)
'Cause I've been waiting here forever
(Let me know where she was going, I don't mind)
Oh, baby baby, if you seek Amy tonight (Oh!)
Oh, baby baby, we'll do whatever you like
Oh baby, baby, baby
Oh baby, baby, baby

La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
