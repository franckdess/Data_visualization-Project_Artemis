I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together
Get it together
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together

You don't know
The pain that I feel
You've taken my love for granted
And you just wanna see it your way, yeah
It's about that time
I'm gonna tell you
What's on my mind
(What's on my mind)
I'm fed up with you
Not being here with me
When you know love is all I need

I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together
Get it together
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together

I cannot go
'Cause being confused just takes control
I hope we can start brand new
'Cause I don't want to lose you, oh no
With a love we share
Baby, it's oh so rare
I'm willing to try
And make you see
That all you need is here in me

I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
But you gotta let me know
How you feel
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
But you gotta let me know
How you feel

I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together
Get it together
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together

See, I'm so confused
I just don't know what to do
And I don't understand, no
You know, I don't wanna stay
You know, I don't wanna go
Baby, please
Listen to me
I don't wanna

I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together
Get it together
I don't really wanna go...
