Mike Jones
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, 8 0 0 4
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, before I got my major deal

I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller she would
Want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' hoe ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Because they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
