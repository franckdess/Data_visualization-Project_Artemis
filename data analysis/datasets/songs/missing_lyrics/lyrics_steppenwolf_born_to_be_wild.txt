Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way

Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under

Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
