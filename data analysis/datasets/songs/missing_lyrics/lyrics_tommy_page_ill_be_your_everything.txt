So long that I've waited for a girl
To come into my life and in my world
I can't explain my feelings for you
I guess you're just all my dreams come true
And I'll be your lover (your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, I'll be your friend)
I'll be there when you're needing me (when you need me)
I'll be your everything, your everything
I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll be all that you want and all that you need
I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me
I'll be your everything
Now that we're together at last
We shouldn't think about our problems in the past
'Cause true love takes a miracle to find
I guess that I've been blessed 'cause I've got you by my side
And I'll be your lover (your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, I'll be your friend)
I'll be there when you're needing me (when you need me)
I'll be your everything, your everything
I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me
I'll be your everything
When you're lost and you're down and you're seeing darkness
And there's no one there that can be found
Just turn around, I'll be there holding out my arms for you
Just reach for me, I'll be the one to set you free
I'll be your everything
I'll be all that you want and all that you need
I'll lift you up when you're feeling down
I'll make your whole world turn around
I'll give my heart and soul to you
To let you know this love is true
I'll be your everything
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me
I'll be your everything
I'll lift you up when you're feeling down
I'll make your whole world turn around
I'll give my heart and soul to you
To let you know this love is true
Ooh, I'll be your everything
