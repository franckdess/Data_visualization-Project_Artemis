KLF KLF is gonna rock ya
KLF is gonna rock ya 'cos you
Have to
Move to the flow of the P.D. blaster
Bass ballistics
I'm gonna kick this hard
And you can catch it
Down with the crew crew
Talking 'bout the Mu Mu
Justified Ancient Liberation Zulu
Got to teach and everything you learn
Will point to the fact that time is eternal
Sample city through Trancentral
Basic face kick elemental
Swings brings new technology
The 'K' the 'L' the 'F' and the ology
Da Force coming down with mayhem
Looking at my watch; time: 3 A.M
Got to see that everywhere I turn
Will point to the fact that time is eternal
It's 3 A.M., 3 A.M., It's 3 A.M. eternal
