Well you know I can be found
Sitting all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please forget the past
The future's bright ahead
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over and love me
You know I want you to stay
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Let's walk down to the preacher
Let's say "Hey, I do"
And then I know you'll want me
And you'll know I want you too
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't need no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over and love me
You know I want you to stay
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
Baby, you know I love you, cross my heart
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of
