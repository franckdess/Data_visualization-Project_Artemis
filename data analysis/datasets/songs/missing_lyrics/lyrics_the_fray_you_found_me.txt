I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone smoking his last cigarette
I said, "Where you been?" He said, "Ask anything"

Where were you when everything was falling apart?
All my days were spent by a telephone
That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

In the end, everyone ends up alone
Losing her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Early morning the city breaks and I've been calling for years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages, you never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve taking all I want

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait to find me, to find me?
