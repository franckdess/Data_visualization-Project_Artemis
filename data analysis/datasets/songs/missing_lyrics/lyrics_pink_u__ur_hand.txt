Check it out, goin' out on the late night
Lookin' tight, feelin' nice, it's a cock fight
I can tell, I just know, that it's going down
Tonight

At the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar six shots just beginnin'
That's when dickhead put his hands on me
But you see

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance, by myself, guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one
Buh-bye

Listen up; it's just not happening
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight
Aight

I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight

Break-break-break-break-break it down
You're in the corner with your boys you bet them five bucks
You'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah

You know who you are
High fivin', talking shit, but you're goin' home alone aren't ya?

'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment (No)
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second (Just stop and take a second)
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over (Know it's over)
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight (It's just you and your hand)
I'm not here for your entertainment (No, no, no)
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second (Just take a second)
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight (Yeah, ohh)
