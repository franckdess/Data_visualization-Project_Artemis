When it's over
That's the time I fall in love again
And when it's over
That's the time you're in my heart again

And when you go, go, go, go
I know, it never ends, never ends

All the things that I used to say
All the words that got in the way
All the things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All the things that she used to bring
All the songs that she used to sing
All the favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window

I'm missing you
I never knew how much you loved me
I'm missing you
I never knew how much you meant to me
I need you

And when you go, go, go, go
I know, it never ends, never ends

All the things that I used to say
All the words that got in the way
All the things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All the things that she used to bring
All the songs that she used to sing
All the favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window

I'm wishing you
You never said you were pretending
I'm wishing you
You'd feel the same and just come back to me
I need you

And when you go, go, go, go
I know, it never ends, never ends

When it's over
Can I still come over?
(And when you go)
And when it's over
Is it really over?

When it's over
That's the time I fall in love again

All the things that I used to say
All the words that got in the way
All the things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All the things that she used to bring
All the songs that she used to sing
All the favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window
All the things that I used to say
All the words that got in the way
All the things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All the things that she used to bring
All the songs that she used to sing
All the favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window
All the things that I used to say
All the words that got in the way
All the things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All the things that she used to bring
All the songs that she used to sing
All the favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window
