I can’t help but wait
Oh, I can’t help but wait
Check it out, uh

I see you, you're with him, he ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by while he lies then turn right round and forgive
I can’t take to see your face with those tears running down your cheeks
But what can I do? I gotta stay true 'cause deep down I’m still a G

And I don’t wanna come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be getting all that someone’s got
You should be rocking the latest in purses, bracelets and watches
You’re worth much more than an occasional
'I love you, I’m thinking of you'

And I don’t wanna come between you and your man, no
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

Get it together, you can do better
Seeing is believing and I see what you need so
I’m gon' to play my position, let you catch what you’ve been missing
I'm calling out, girl 'cause

I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait
'Til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

Can’t help but wait, no no no no no no
I can’t help but wait, oh
Can’t help but wait, no no no
