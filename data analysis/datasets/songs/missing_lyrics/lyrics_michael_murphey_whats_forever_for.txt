I've been looking at people and how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds
Maybe it's me who's gone crazy, but I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?

And I see love hungry people tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

So, what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?
