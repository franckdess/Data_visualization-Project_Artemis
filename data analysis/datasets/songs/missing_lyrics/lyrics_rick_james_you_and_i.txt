You and I
We fit together like a glove on hand
That's right
Don't you know
That I would gladly take you anywhere
You wanted to go
You and me
We are as close as three-part harmony
Wouldn't you agree
And if by chance
Our romance ended it would surely be
The end of me

Some people might say I'm infatuated
But I don't care
Cause they really don't know
They'll never see or hear
The things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned
They all can go to hell

Whoe, baby yeah
Now sing it, sugar
Do-do-do
Now sing it, baby

You and I
We'll be together 'till the six is nine
That's right
When you need me
I never hesitate, I always come
It's so much fun, yeah
You and I
Although we're poor
Our love has greater wealth
Than Hughes himself
And if by chance
There is an afterlife when we die
Hope it's with you and I

Some people might say I'm infatuated
But I don't care
Cause they really don't know
They'll never see of hear
The things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned
They all can go to hell

Baby sing it for me
Sing it to me, baby
I said take it baby
You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally
You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally
You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally
Eternally will be you and me
