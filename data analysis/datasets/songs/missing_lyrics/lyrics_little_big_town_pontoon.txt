Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a coozie
Let's go
Who said anything about skiing?
Floating is all I want to do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

On the pontoon
Making waves and catching rays up on the roof
Jumping out the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmmm motorboating

(Hoo hoo hoo)

Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black inner tube


(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)

5 mile an hour with aluminum side
Wood paneling with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride


On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)
On the pontoon
(Hoo hoo hoo)
Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon

(Hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo hoo hoo)
