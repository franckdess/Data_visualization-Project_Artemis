I'm coming down
Coming down like a monkey
But it's alright
Like a load on your back that you can't see
Ooh, but it's alright
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, just let it go
Get it away from me

'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I'm going down
Going down, like a monkey, ooh
But it's alright
Try to pick yourself up
Carry that weight that you can't see
Don't you know it's alright
It's like a helter skelter
Going down and down, round and round
But just get it away from me, oh

'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
We're gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I got some money in my pocket
About ready to burn
I don't remember where I got it
I gotta get it to you
So please answer the phone
'Cause I keep calling
But you're never home
What am I gonna do?

Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

You keep telling me I've got everything
You say I've got everything I want
You keep telling me you're gonna help me
You're gonna help me, but you don't
But now I'm in too deep
You see it's got me so that I just can't sleep
Oh get me out of here
Please get me out of here
Just help me, I'll do anything, anything
If you'll just help, get me out of here

I'm coming down
Coming down like a monkey
But it's alright
It's like a load on your back that you can't see
Ooh, but you know that it's alright
Just try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go
Just get it away from me, oh

'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Please get me out of here
Just someone get me out of here
Just help me, I'll do anything, anything
If you'll just help, get me out of here

Tonight, oh
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Yes I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

(Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh)
