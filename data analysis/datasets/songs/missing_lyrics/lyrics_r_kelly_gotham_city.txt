I'm looking over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

A city of justice
A city of love
A city of peace
For every one of us
We all need it
Can't live without it
A Gotham City
Oh, yeah

How sleeping awake because of fear, oh yeah
How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero, even me

A city of justice, yeah
A city of love
A city of peace
For every one of us
'Cause we all need it, yeah
Can't live without it
A Gotham City
Yeah yeah

A city of justice, yeah
A city of love, woo
A city of peace
For every one of us
'Cause we all need it yeah
Can't live without it
A Gotham City, woo
Yeah yeah

Yet in the middle of stormy weather
We won't stumble
And we won't fall
I know a place that offers shelter

(A city of justice), oh yeah
