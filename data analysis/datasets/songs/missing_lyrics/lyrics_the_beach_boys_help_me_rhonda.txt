Well, since she put me down I've been out doin' in my head
I come in late at night and in the mornin' I just lay in bed

Well, Rhonda you look so fine (Look so fine)
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda, help, help me, Rhonda

Help me, Rhonda, yeah, get her out of my heart

She was gonna be my wife and I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it shattered our plan

Well, Rhonda, you caught my eye (Caught my eye)
And I can give you lots of reasons why
You gotta help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

Help me, Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda
