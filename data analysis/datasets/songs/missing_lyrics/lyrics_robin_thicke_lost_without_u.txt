I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy, baby
That you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy, you don't want that guy
You wanna touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel, baby
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby
Tell me you depend on it, I need to hear it

I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

Baby, you're the perfect shape
Baby, you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday
I want it this way, I want it that way, I want it
Tell me you don't want me to stop (Don't stop)
Tell me it would break your heart
But you love me and all my dirty
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby

I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

Cause you will tell me every morning
Ooh, alright, baby
Oh, yeah, oh, baby
Oh, darling, alright

I'm lost without you! Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

Ooh yeah, oh baby
Oh darlin', all right-right
Oh baby, oh darlin'
Ooh, ooh, baby, all right-right
Yeah
