I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me, I see, everything clearer now
The nights is black as, black as its ever been
Without my girl, I'm gonna lose it
I pray that he would just shed his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby

Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right wit you
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, Feels like I just walk right out of heaven

See my mama told me that's if its meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do it to just let her, let her go
I know, I don't wanna do it
But if I continue to push she'll just pull away
And I know that in my heart its a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
And I hope that shes not gone for good no no

Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right wit you
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, Feels like I just walk right out of heaven

Hey girl waiting for you all the time
Suppose to move on with my life, and girl I tried and I tried
I feel like I can't walk, I feel like I can't talk girl
I don't know what to do get back right with you
I feel like I just Walked outta heaven

If u ever loved somebody
And if you ever had somebody
But you know that you hurt that somebody
Let me here you say yea

Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right wit you
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, Feels like I just walk right out of heaven
