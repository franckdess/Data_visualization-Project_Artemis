Last night I slept alone
I stayed at home
For the first time since you've been gone, babe
No friends to understand
To lend a helping hand
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known
How you walked away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me?
Yes, you promised me that
You'd never leave, boy
But you went away, babe
And it's such a shame
How could you turn your back on me?

If you really don't want me
If you really don't need me
If you really don't love me
Tell me who do you love?
If you really don't want me
If you really don't need me
If you really don't love me
Then who do you love?

I gave, gave everything
A man could ever need
I was there whenever you would call me baby
But somehow your feelings changed
You don't act the same
I guess you're not the man
That I once knew at all
How you walked away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me?
Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy
Now the love is gone babe
Tell me what went wrong
How could you leave me hanging on?
Oh, baby


I once was blind
But baby, now I see
That I'm not the one
Who can fill your every need
I painted a picture so clear
It's reality
Now I know
Yes, I know
That you're not the one for me
Ooooh, baby
Oh, yeah
Who do you love, baby?
If you don't want me
If you don't need me
How could you walk away from me?
Baby, you promised you'd never leave
Slept alone since you've been gone
The greatest pain I've ever known
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
Oh ,yeah
