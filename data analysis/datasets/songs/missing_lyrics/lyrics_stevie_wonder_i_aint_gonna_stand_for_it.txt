Don't wanna believe what they're telling me
Somebody's been picking in my cherry tree
Don't wanna mistrust nobody by mistake
But I can tell someone's been digging round in my cake

And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby

Don't wanna believe what somebody said
But somebody said somebody's shoes was under my bed
Don't wanna cause nobody no bodily harm
But somebody's been rubbing on my good luck charm

And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby


And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
