I like where we are
When we drive, in your car
I like where we are, here

'Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch, here

Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

I like where you sleep
When you sleep, next to me
I like where you sleep, here

Our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
'Cause our lips can touch, here

Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Our lips can touch
Our lips can touch, here

Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite terribly"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Well, you are the one, the one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I've missed you quite, I've missed you quite"
I fell in love, in love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else I could be but here in your arms

Here in your arms
But here in your arms
