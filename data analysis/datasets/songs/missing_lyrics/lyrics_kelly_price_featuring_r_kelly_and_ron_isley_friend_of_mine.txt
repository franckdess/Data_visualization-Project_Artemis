Yeah Kelly, you there?
Now, listen baby
I got your message
I'm just confused
I don't understand everything but
I'm on my way over there to you
Now you stay on the phone
And tell me everything that went down

See I was the one
Who picked her up when so called friends let her down
(Uh huh)
And I was the one
Who took her in when that fool put her out
(I know)
Yeah, a true friend indeed
You see I was there when chips was going down
(You know I know)
Um, but she betrayed me
Caught him with her coming in from out of town
(You WHAT?!)
Tell me why? (Aww, SHIT!)

Why ya ya, (Whyyy?) why yah yah
Why yah yah, why yah yah
I wanna know
Why yah yah, why yah yah (Why, baby?!)
Why yah yah, why yah yah

Now I put my trust in him
I can't believe he slept with her behind my back (Oh)
I went out on a limb
I even covered up to keep his thing in tact (Yeah)
Um.. what I had in me, yeah
Was something real that's so hard to come about, Uh
(Oh, oh)
But he betrayed me
There was a photo in some laundry that I found
Tell me why

Why ya ya, (Whyyy?) why yah yah
Why yah yah, why yah yah
I put all my trust in you, baby
Why yah yah, why yah yah (Ooh, why?!)
Why yah yah, why yah yah

She was my best friend
(oh yeah, oh yeah)
Hung with me through thick and thin
(My homey, my homey)
Sisters to the very end
(And I)
I can't believe it
Can't believe it
Can't believe it
He was everything to me
(Everything to me, baby)
Now out the door he's history
(Oh now ya gotta go on)
We could've had everything
(And I)
I can't believe it
Can't believe it
Can't believe it

 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
 Why, why, why
 Why
 Can't believe I trusted you
 Kelly, let me call him up
 No, no, no, no
 And just talk to him
 There's nothing to say
Because it's too late, oh
 Oh, I know it, but it's just the principle
About the whole thing, oh
I'm your Godfather
And I can't stand for nobody to hurt you, baby
 No, no, no, no
 So just call him up
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna
 Call him baby, call him right now
 I'm callin', I'm callin', I'm callin'
 Call him up.....
 Hello? Who's this?
 This is Mr. Biggs
 How ya doin' Mr. Biggs
 What the hell is going on?
 What you mean what's goin' on?
 Kelly's telling me
That you're sleeping with another woman
 Just because she sees me wit her
Doesn't mean I'm sleeping wit her
 Well, if you're not sleepin' with her
What the hell you doin' with her
 Damn, I could be just talkin' to her
 Or you could be just creepin' with her
Now son, man to man, we both know the game
 Yeah, but what's that got to.....
 Wait a minute
And you know all about heartache and pain
This is my Goddaughter
And I'm just trying to protect her heart
 Don't waste your time
 You may have been a moon to her
But to me she's the star, oh

Why ya ya, why ya ya

 Why, why
 Kelly, take this phone!

She was my best friend
You were my husband
Oh, but I don't want you
No, no, no more
Said I don't want you
No, no, no, no more
See you shaped and molded me
To be what you wanted me to be
She was a leaf in your life
But I was the root to your tree, oh
