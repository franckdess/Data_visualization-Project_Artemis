Didn't I hear you cry this morning, didn't I feel you weep?
Teardrops flowin' down on me, like rivers in my sleep
And in my dream of laughter, you came creepin' with your fears
Telling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no

Didn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name?
I heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain
And in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun
Waiting for the laughter, but the laughter never comes

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody, dont cry to me, no
Dont cry to me, no

Didn't you feel alone this morning, didn't you need a friend?
And in your darkest hour, you came runnin' back again

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
