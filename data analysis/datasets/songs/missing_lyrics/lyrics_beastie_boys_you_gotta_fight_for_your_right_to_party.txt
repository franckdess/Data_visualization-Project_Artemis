Kick it!
You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?" but she still says "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kinda jerk
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
Your pop's caught you smokin', man, and he says "No way."
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, livin' at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
Busted!
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
You gotta fight
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said "What's that noise?"
Aw, mom, you're just jealous, it's the Beastie Boys
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
Party
Party
