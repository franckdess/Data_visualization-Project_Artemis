Baby face Madonna
Glory, Hosanna
Queen of the garden
Rose on your palm
As sweet as your karma
Ven a mi cama
Break like a comma
Plucked from the harvest
Start up a fire
Eyes of a fighter
Fear in your iris
Storm to the gaze of the ones who despise ya
I know you're tired

Tired of the same old, same old
Wishing you could stay home, lay low
Tired of the same old, same old

Baby face Madonna
Glory, Hosanna
Grace like your momma
Strength like your momma
Both hate your father
Step to the thunder
Clear up the sky
It reminds you of summer
Reminds of you of times way before you went under
I know you're trying
I know you're tired

Tired of the same old, same old
Wishing you could stay home, lay low
Tired of the same old, same old

Hand me a bible
Search for your likeness
I couldn't find it
Must be in hiding
God bless your kindness
Baby face Madonna
Born from the fire
Thought I was strong
But you made me a liar
We rest in the quiet
I can sense that you like it
I know you're tired

Tired of the same old, same old
Wishing you could stay home, lay low
Tired of the same old, same old

No room to breathe
We wait in the water
Papa told me you're his favorite daughter
So you'll go to sleep and wake up tomorrow
With a head full of bees and mouth full of sorrow
No room to breathe
(You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all)
We wait in the water
Papa told me you're his favorite daughter
(You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all)
So you'll go to sleep and wake up tomorrow
(You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all)
With a head full of bees and mouth full of sorrow
(You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all)
You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all
You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all
You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all
You went back and bent backwards just to make sense of it all, sense of it all
