Feeling better now that we're through
Feeling better cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
{Instrumental}
I'm turning you down baby and I'm going my way
Forget about you baby cause I'm leaving to stay
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
Oh, oh no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
