Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, Shamone
Lay it on me, all right
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?


We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm saying
Then won't you slap my face?

Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, you know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know it, you know, you know, you know (Really, really bad)
You know, shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I move, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know (Really, really bad)
Shamone, You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know I'm bad
You know, woo! (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (really, really bad)
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?
