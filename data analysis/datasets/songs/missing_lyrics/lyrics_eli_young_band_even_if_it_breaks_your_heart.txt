Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Keep on dreamin'
Don't let it break your heart
