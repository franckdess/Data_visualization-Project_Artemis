Baby, look at me
And tell me what you see
You ain't seen the best of me yet
Give me time, I'll make you forget the rest
I got more in me
And you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hands
Don't you know who I am?
Remember my name
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
(High!)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame!)
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
Baby hold me tight
'Cause you can make it right
You can shoot me straight to the top
Give me love and take all I've got to give
Baby I'll be tough
Too much is not enough
I'll grab your heart til it breaks
Oooh I got what it takes
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
(High!)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame!)
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
(High!)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame!)
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember my name
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
(High!)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame!)
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my...
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Fame!)
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my...
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember my name)
(Fame!)
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
(High!)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
(Fame!)
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky...
