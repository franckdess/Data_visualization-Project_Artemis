Act a fool, you better watch out
Hot shit be bringin the cops out
Street niggas is ringin them shots out
Short circuit and blacken the blocks out
Now open up the garage and pull the drops out
Rockin the fur coat bringin the blue fox out
Diamonds light up the block, runnin the blue rocks out
Whylin till all of my crew knocks out
Get yo' ass up on the floor
Huh, throw ya hands if you wan't some more
Baby, wiggle your crotch out, huh
And peep the way we be blowin them spots out
C'mon, look how we got 'em ready to act out
Girl, I'm ready to give it twistin your back out
Drink yack till a nigga fallin out
Flat on his back now watch a nigga crawlin out, talk to me

I said Busta (whassup son?)
You leave them girls rollin' and it look like (c'mon)
They asses is swollen (and they ass gettin big now)
But if your man babysittin (uh-huh) then what you gon' say?
(What we gon' tell 'em man?)
We gon' tell that nigga (Pass the Courvoisier)
We gon' tell that brotha (Pass the Courvoisier)
Everybody sing it now {Pass the Courvoisier}
Everybody sing it now {Pass the Courvoisier}

Girl, you need to shake it off
Too much hair on your cho-cha, then shave it off
C'mon, jump smack yo' ass and break it off
And if it's too hot for y'all? You need to take it off
In case you ain't knowin niggas we on a roll now
Diddy, like we done stumbled on a pot of gold now - c'mon
Food spillin all out of the bowl now, huh!
Money thick, get harder to fold now - c'mon
Ladies tell me if you're feelin {alright}
And are you sure that you up for doin it {all night}
I like this
Listen, before you ass bet, nigga
We wreck shit and we ain't even blacked yet
Niggas all around and police rapidly shut down the block
And the club ain't even packed yet - c'mon
Nuff drinkin at the bar hold it down whylin out
'til the club is closed down, talk to me

I said Busta (whassup son?)
You leave them girl rollin... and it look like (c'mon)
They asses is swollen (and they ass gettin big now)
But if your man babysittin (uh-huh) then what you gon' say
(What we gon' tell 'em man?)

We gon' tell that brotha (Pass the Courvoisier)
Everybody sing it now {Pass the Courvoisier}
