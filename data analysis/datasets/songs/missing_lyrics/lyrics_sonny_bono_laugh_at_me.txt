Let’s go for a smoke
I think you smoke the kinda smokes that I smoke
Isn’t it fun the way I laugh at your jokes
You could be sharing at the Sonny Bono
At the bar, oh oh
In your car, oh oh
Circle k, okay
Be my bae, baby
It’s hard to be alone
I know you think so too, you always ask me to drive you home
And we roll down the window
Hope for something good on the radio
In your car, oh oh
At the bar, oh oh
Circle k, okay
Be my bae, baby
