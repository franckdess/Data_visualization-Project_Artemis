But I think you got it wrong
But can't you say goodnight
So you can take me home Mickey
'Cause when you say you will
It always means you won't
You're giving me the chills

Every night you still leave me all alone Mickey

A little more show

So come on and give it to me anyway you can
Anyway you wanna do it

But please baby please, don't leave me in the damn
