Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They've all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

(They said it wouldn't last)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without you)

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without

I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Has quite the same, ooh ooh
Like you do, do, do, do babe

(They said it wouldn't last)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without you)
Do without you
Love would never do without you
Whoo!
Do without you

Ooh
Ooh
Go on
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Oh yeah
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Not for me
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Oh yeah
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Baby
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Oh yeah
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Baby
(Love would never do) Fine
(Never do without you) Oh oh
(Love would never do) Whoo!
(Never do without you) Say it!
(Love will never do) Never do
(Love will never do without you) Ooh ooh
(Love will never do) Never
(Love will never do without you) Ooh ooh
(Love will never do)
(Love will never do without you)
Baby, yeah

What?
(They said it)
(They said it wouldn't last)
(They said it)
(They said it wouldn't last) Whoo!
(They said) Hey
(They said it wouldn't) What do you want?
(They said it wouldn't last)
If you believe in love say
(Love will never do)
(Love will never do without you)
(Love will never do)
(Love will never do without you)
(They said it wouldn't last)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without you)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without you)
(We had to prove them wrong)
(Cause I've learned in the past)
(That love would never do without)
(Do without)
(You)
(They said it)
