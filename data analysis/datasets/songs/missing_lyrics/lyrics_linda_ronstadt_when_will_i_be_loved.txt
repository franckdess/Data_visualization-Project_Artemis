I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?

I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?


When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?
