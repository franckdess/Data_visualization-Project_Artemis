Over Mountains
Over Trees
Over Oceans
Over Seas
Across the desert
I'll be there
In a whisper on the wind
On the smile of a new friend
Just think of me
And I'll be there
Don't be afraid, oh my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight
To be with you
Because I'm on your side
And I still care
I may have died
But I've gone nowhere
Just think of me
And I'll be there
On the edge of a waking dream
Over Rivers
Over Streams
Through Wind and Rain
I'll be there
Across the wide and open sky
Thousands of miles I'd fly
To be with you
I'll be there
Don't be afraid, oh my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight
To be with you
Because I'm on your side
And I still care
I may have died
But I've gone nowhere
Just think of me
And I'll be there
In the breath of a wind that sighs
Oh, there's no need to cry
Just think of me
And I'll be there
