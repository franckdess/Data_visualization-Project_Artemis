Song sung blue, everybody knows one
Song sung blue, every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to
The blues now and then
But when you take the blues
And make a song
You sing 'em out again
You sing 'em out again
Song sung blue, weeping like a willow
Song sung blue, sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it get to feeling good
You simply got no choice
Me and you are subject to
The blues now and then
But when you take the blues
And make a song
You sing 'em out again
Song sung blue, weeping like a willow
Song sung blue, sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it start to feeling good
You simply got no choice
Song sung blue
Song sung blue
Funny thing
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
