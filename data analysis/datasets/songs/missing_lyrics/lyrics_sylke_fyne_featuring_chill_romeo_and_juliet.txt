Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet
You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet
Yep!
It's like Romeo and Juliet
Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet
You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet
Yep!
Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact
On how ya make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind
Usually I don't play it that close
You got's to kick it wit me
Before I serve you up
With an overdose
Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny
Make you my man
I ain't got no love
For nobody else but you
Cuz you's my boo
I prove to you
My love be true
So do you know where you goin' to
Through thick and thin, baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end
My heart keep tickin'
No time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin'
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat you like my king
Cuz you royal
And only give my love to you
Because I'm loyal, escape with me
Come over to my place
I'll teach you a few things in love makin'
Now I can't wait, I won't wait
So take me by my arms and rock me baby
Cuz I'mma always and forever be yo lady
Repeat 1
After our first night
You discovered who's the bombest mommy
L.A.'s finest with my top dogs all around me
Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde
We're sexual healers, do ya feel this
Baby, check my vibe
They'll never be a love like me
That got your back in this industry
That got your back in these streets
So you don't have to worry 'bout me
On the creep
And I don't want you ever to try to
Play me cheap
Cuz I don't sleep around
Because it's sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy
And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated
Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around
Then I'm gon' have to chill
When ya find good love
You best to keep it
I'm puttin' all my sista's up on game
So whyn't cha' peep it
Repeat 1 until fade
