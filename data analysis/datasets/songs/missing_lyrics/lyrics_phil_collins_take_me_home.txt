Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm

So, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off the light

But, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

Take that look of worry
Mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons
I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen
Oh, but I know who they are

And, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord

Well I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you, but I don't remember

Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember...
