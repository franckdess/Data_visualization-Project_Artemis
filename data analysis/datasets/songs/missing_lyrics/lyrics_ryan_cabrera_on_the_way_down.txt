Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Tripping over myself
Going nowhere
Waiting, suffocating, no direction
I took a dive and...

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

Been wondering why it's only me
Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's alright, sunlight on my face
I wake up and yet, I'm alive
'Cause...

On the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you

I was so afraid of going under
But now, the weight of the world
Feels like nothing
No nothing (down, down, down)
You're all I wanted (down, down, down)
You're all I needed (down, down, down)
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed
And I won't forget the way you loved me
All that I wanted, all that I needed now

Oh, on the way down
I saw you, and you saved me from myself
And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held on to you (down, down, down)
But I held on to you (down, down, down)
But I held on to you
