Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Givin' it up for your love - I said everything
Givin' it up for your love right now, right now
My heart is aching for you, I can't stand it
I need your lovin', am I so demanding?
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
I'm givin' it up for your love right now
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
I'm givin' it up for your love right now
Well, I thought about it
You know I'm not playing
You better listen to me
Every word I been saying
Hot is cold and cold is hot
I'm a little mixed up
But I'll give it everything I've got
Don't want your money, baby, don't need your car
I'm doing all right, doing all right so far
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
I'm givin' it up for your love right now
Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love somehow
I know you told me
That you'd always love me
And I believed it was true
So I saved the best and I'm ready
My love only just for you
Come back here, come back real quick
My heart is aching and my body is feeling weak
I'll be all right, yes, I'll be OK
Come on now baby, listen to what I say
Don't want your money, baby, don't need your car
Been doing all right, doing all right so far
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
I'm givin' it up for your love right now
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
I'm givin' it up for your love somehow
I'm givin' it up for your love - I said everything
I'm givin' it up for your love right now
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
I'm givin' it up for your love somehow
