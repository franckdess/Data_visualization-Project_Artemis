Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
You pack your bag
You take control
You're movin' into my heart
And into my soul
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I won't be walking on thin ice
To get through the night
Hey, where's your work?
What's your game?
I know your business
Don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
You turn around
So hot and dry
You're hidin' under a halo
Your mouth is alive
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I'm not attracted to gogo
Deeper tonight
Hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business
But I don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
Hey, hey, hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business
But I don't know your name
Hold on tight
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
She's armed and she's extremely dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
Oh, oh oh, hey, where's your work?
Mmm, what's your game?
I don't know your name
Hey, you!
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous
I don't know your name
