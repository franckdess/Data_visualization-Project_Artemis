Comin' on strong, comin' on strong
I can feel the heartaches
Comin' on strong
I can feel the teardrops, the pain, and the sorrow
Ever since you've been gone, they' been
Comin' on strong
Pain, come on in, hello sorrow
I see you're back again
Teardrops, glad you dropped by
'Cause you can help drown my pride
And since you're here, time seems just fine
To let you know that you're gonna be with me
'Til I lose my mind
But you've been gone
Much too long and I can feel the heartaches
Comin' on strong
Only thing you left me, was misery for company
And memories of a love gone wrong, that keep
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
Comin' on strong. Comin' on strong
