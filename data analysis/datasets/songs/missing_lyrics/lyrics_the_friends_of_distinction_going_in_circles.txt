I'm an ever rollin' wheel, without a destination real
I'm an ever spinning top, whirling around till i drop
Oh but what am i to do, my mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope, one small thing to cling to
You got me going in circles(oh round and round i go)
You got me going in circles
(oh round and round i go, i'm spun out over you)
I'm a faceless clock, with timeless hopes that never stop
Lord but i feel that way, of my soul. My soul is stay
Oh but what am i to do, my mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope, one small thing to cling to
You got me going in circles(oh round and round i go)
You got me going in circles
(oh round and round i go) I'm spun out over you
(i need you baby) over you (i need you baby) spun out over you
(i need you baby, i need you baby baby) (oh baby)
I'm spun(i need you baby) i said i'm spun out over you(i need you baby)
Spun out over you(i need you baby, i need you baby, i need you baby)
