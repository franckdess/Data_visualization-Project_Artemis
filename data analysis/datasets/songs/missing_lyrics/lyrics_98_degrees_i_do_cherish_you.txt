All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world
All that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes
Shining at me
When you smile I can feel
All my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations
Seduce me 'cause I

I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

In my world before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
'Til that day i found you
How you opened my life
To a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all my heart
'Til my dying day

I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
Yes, I do
I do
If you're asking do I love you this much
Baby, I do cherish you from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, baby I do
I do
