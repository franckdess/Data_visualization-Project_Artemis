Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo with the big guitars
And that's all right
Yeah (all right)
I got the itch and a restless soul
She gone with the wind, gonna go for broke tonight, yeah
And that's (all night)
Girl, we've been meant for this since we were born (since we were born)
No problems now, the coast is clear (ooh)
It's just the calm before the storm
This must be just like livin' in paradise (just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (and I never wanna go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home
Dig it, dig it
Suzy, Suzy, girl, for cryin' out loud
You got all the right moves
You make me eat my heart out nightly
Aw (that's all right with me) yeah
No special favors, make it out to cash
We'll spend it later, got to make this romance last
And (last)
That's it, that's it
Some folks say easy come is easy go (and some folks say)
But one night ain't enough for me
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go
This must be just like livin' in paradise (it's just like paradise, hey)
And I don't wanna go home (and I ain't never goin' home)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (just like, just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home, wow
Ho ho, ho
Aw yeah
Whoo
This must be just like livin' in paradise (in paradise, paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (and I don't, I don't wanna go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (I'm never goin' home)
And I don't wanna go home (wow, 1-800-SEE-YA, baby)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (wow, hey hey)
(Just like paradise, just like) This must be just like livin' in paradise
