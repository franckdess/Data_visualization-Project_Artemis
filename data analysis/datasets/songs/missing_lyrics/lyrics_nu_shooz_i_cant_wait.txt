Baby, I can't wait

My love, tell me what it's all about
You've got something
That I can't live without
Happiness, is so hard to find
Hey baby, tell me what is on your mind

Cause I can't wait (baby, I can't wait)
Till you call me on the telephone
I can't wait (baby, I can't wait)
Till we're all alone (I can't wait)

You know I love you
Even when you don't try
I know, that our love will never die
Hey darling, when you look into my eye
Please tell me, you'll never have to say goodbye

Cause I can't wait (baby, I can't wait) this is what I've been waiting for
I can't wait (baby, I can't wait) 'till my love walked in the door
I can't wait (baby, I can't wait) true love is so hard to find
I found yours, you found mine
I can't wait (baby, I can't wait) tell me what is on your mind (I can't wait)

(I can't wait) I can't wait
Say it one more time (baby, I can't wait) tell me what is on your mind
Oh I can't wait (baby, I can't wait) this is what I've been waiting for
Oh I can't wait (baby, I can't wait) 'till my love walked in the door
