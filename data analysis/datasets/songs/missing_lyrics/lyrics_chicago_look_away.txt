When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"
Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming around
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby, whoa...
And from what you saying
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be
So if it's got to be this way
Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be
I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, whoa...
I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you
I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way


If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
If we meet on the streets someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me
If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away
Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me

When you called me up this morning
Told me about the new love you found
I said "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"
