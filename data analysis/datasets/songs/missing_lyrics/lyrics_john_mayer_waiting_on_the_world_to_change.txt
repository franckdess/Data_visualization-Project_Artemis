Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change


And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting, waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is going to rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
