What I want, you've got
But it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame yeah yeah
What I got -- full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together
And how? I can't explain, oh yeah

Well well you (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
You make my dreams come true (you you) you
(you you)
Well well well you (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true
(ooh oooh ooh ooh) hell yeah

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with a dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same oh yeah

Well cause You (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Hmmm hmm you make my dreams come true (you
You you you) oh yeah
Well well well you (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Ooh you make my dreams come true (you

Well listen to this
Ow!

I'm down on my daydream
All that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know

Well you hell yeah you make my dreams come true
(you you you you) oh yeah

I've been waiting for waiting for you girl
(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true
