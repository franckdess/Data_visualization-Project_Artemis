They roll the sidewalks in this town
All up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here
When midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain
I can't sleep with you on my brain
I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold
Nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
This DJ's on a roll

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
Babe we ain't gotta go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
