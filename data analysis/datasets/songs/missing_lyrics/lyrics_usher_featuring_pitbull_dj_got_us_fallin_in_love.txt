Usher, Usher, Usher
Yeah, man

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from
Side to side, side-side to side, uh
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie
Gone back to life, back-back to life

Hands up, uh
And suddenly, we all got our hands up, uh
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (Love again)
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (L-love again-gain)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (L-love again-gain)

Keep downin' drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherf***** down, down, down
Down, down, down, down (Come on)

Hands up, uh
When the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (Love again)
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (L-love again-gain, oh yeah)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (L-love again-gain)(Ohh)

Hear no evil, I speak no evil, I see no evil
Get it, baby, Hope you catch that like T.O
That's how we roll
My life is a movie and you just TiVo, ha
Mami got me twisted like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba-dabba-doo, make her bed rock
Mami on fire, pshh, red hot
Bada bing, bada boom
