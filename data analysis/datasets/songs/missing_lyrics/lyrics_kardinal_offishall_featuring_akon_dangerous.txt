Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me

Whoah! And yeah, that's her
The big dog tryin' to get her little kitty to purr
Ex-man lookin' at me like I'm Lucifer
'Cause he knows how I deal with the case, yes sir!
If I was the last man on Earth
I would only take that girl, end of search
She give a new definition to the word curve
Got chicks in the strip club envyin' her
Body's like weapons of mass eruptions
Sit her glass on that fat obstruction
Tongue game give a new type seduction
I'm tryin' to give that girl somethin', jah!

Whoah! Bad to the bone
Everything locked like a two-three zone
I wanted to make my black snake moan
Talk a likkle bit, then take that home
She bad and she know the deal
That's what I can't hide when she wanna conceal
I mean, Meagan Good and Halle Berry
Put together, ain't close to the dribby I see
No, no, no disrespect
But this gyal upon another level, cut the check
Tell King, Max, stop the press
Say kid, can I get a witness?

Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
From across the room, I can see it
And can't stop myself from lookin'

I see you got that fire
By the way that you walkin'
From left to right I watched her go down
Girl, I just want it right now
Don't wanna do no talkin'
Shorty's so right I need to slow down

Figure eight, good body shape
When she on the dance floor, gyal dem irate
When she do her ting, man can't walk straight
That biscuit fi' soak up erry-ting' on her plate
Bad heels like Jessica P
I'm tryin' to give homegirl Sex in the City-titty
Itty bitty waistline, moves with the baseline
One lick of punch, I'm fine, jah!

Girl, I can't notice but to
Notice you, noticin' me
