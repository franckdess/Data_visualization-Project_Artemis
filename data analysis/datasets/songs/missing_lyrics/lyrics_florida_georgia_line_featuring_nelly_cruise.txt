Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
(Let's go!)

I got my windows down and the radio up (Yeah)
Get your radio up
What up, Nelly? (Alright)
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said (I said)

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit (Hey)
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

Yeah, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck" (I said)

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise (Hey)
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit (Hey)
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)

My windows down, my seats back, my music up and we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard, and it's just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy, like e'rything about you
Don't change a thing, no way, you stay the same and I got you
I likes all that, all that, head to toe, you all that
Tell 'ole boy he call back, send her a text, say "fall back"
'Cause I can see you got a thing for the fast life (For the fast life)
So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like (Uh-huh)
Whipping 'cross the border, Florida into Georgia
'Cause baby, you a song
And you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every hood, ev'ry town with you
And this drop-top Chevy painted real slick
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (You up in it)
'Cause baby, you a song
And you make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my, r-r-r-roll...

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit (Hey)
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it (Come on)
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio up (Come on)
Get your radio up (Yeah, get those windows down and cruise)
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up (Got my windows down and cruise)
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up, up, up, up
