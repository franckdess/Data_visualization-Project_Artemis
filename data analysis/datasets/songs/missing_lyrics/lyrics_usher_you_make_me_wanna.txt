This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how...

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
Come along with
You're making me, you're making me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the...
