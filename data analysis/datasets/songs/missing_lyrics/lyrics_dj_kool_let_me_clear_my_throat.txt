Special dedication going out to everybody here in Bahama Bay

Yeah, rock to the rhythm of the funky rhyme
So I can get busy just one more time
To the beat and ya don't quit
It's that ol' skool rap with that new skool hit
Peter Piper picked a pepper but Kool rocked the rhyme
And I can still rip up the house
Every God damn time I get on the mic, I go crazy
Peace out to Celo, Flex, and Doug Lazy
I bet 'cha never knew but now ya know
I'm the undisputed king of this disco
And I never let the mic, magnetize me no more
Cuz DJ Kool rip up the whole damn floor
Now I'mma rap a rhyme with the greatest of ease
And swing it like the man on the flying trapeze
And if you don't like it you grab on these
And now I need some help from the maestro please
Jam, Ha! So look it here check the flavor of the rhythm I wrote
And while I got a chance here, let me clear my throat
Oh, have mercy babe, ha!
I hope ya don't mind, let me clear my throat
I need these monitors right here
Music in the monitors
And it goes a little something like this here
Ah huh ah huh ah
