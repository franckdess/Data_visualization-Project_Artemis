I think I know what you mean
And although it sounds obscene
I will always do my best to understand
You have so many words
And your voice is always heard
But who can say they really understand?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
Well you say you have a big love
And it really sounds like fun
If I knew what it was
Then I'm sure I'd like to have one
Give me a sign that you
Feel some emotion
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
Say what you like you know that no-one
Really minds
And if there's nothing to say, then
Why don't we all go away?
Do you real-
Do you real-
Do you really feel real?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
But if there's nothing to say, then
Why don't we all go away?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
Do you real-
Do you real-
Do you really feel real?
