You said you didn't need her
You told her good-bye
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wished that you should have her
And you feel like such a fool
You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something

Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that shine at night
Whatever you do
Don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah-yeah
You can blame it on the rain

Should've told her you were sorry
Could have said you were wrong
But no you couldn't do that
You had to prove you were strong
If you hadn't been so blinded
She might still be there with you
You want her back again
But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something
Gotta blame it on something


Cause the rain don't mind
And the rain don't care
You got to blame it on something
