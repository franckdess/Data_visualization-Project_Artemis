You set my soul at ease
Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do
I've got so much more to give
This can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I'm gonna love you forever, oh-oh

My mind fails to understand
What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you
And that would do
I've always been taught to win
And I never thought I'd fall
Be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
Now I only want to be right where you are

I wanna love you forever (I wanna love you forever)
And this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew (I swear)
I'm gonna love you forever
Whoa, oh-oh

In my life, I've learned that heaven never waits, no
Let's take this now before it's gone like yesterday, no
'Cause when I'm with you, there's nowhere else
That I would ever wanna be, no
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you loving me
I'm gonna love...

I wanna lover you forever
Oh, and this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together (My love)
Is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew (Oh)
I'm gonna love you forever, forever, oh

I wanna love you forever
Everyday, everyday
10,000 lifetimes together
