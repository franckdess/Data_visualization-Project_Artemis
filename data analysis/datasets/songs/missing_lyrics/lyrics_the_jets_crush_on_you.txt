How did you know
'Cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush on you

You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talking
When she should be listening
Can't keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her
With all I felt inside

I never knew
A rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out
All over town
That I'm longing for you


Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face?
Were my emotions so easily read
That you would know my love
Before a word was said

Was it my eyes
That let you know you had control?
Because the way you move
Was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender



You found out
I've got a crush on you
You found out
I've got a crush on you
You found out
I've got a crush on you
You found out
I've got a crush on you
You found out
I've got a crush on you
Crush on you
Crush on you
Crush on you
Crush on you
