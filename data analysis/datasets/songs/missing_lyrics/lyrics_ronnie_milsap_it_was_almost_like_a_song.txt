Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song

You were in my heart
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song

January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flames became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
(Cries for you each night)
And it's almost like a song
(Almost like a song)
But it's much too sad to write
It's too sad to write
