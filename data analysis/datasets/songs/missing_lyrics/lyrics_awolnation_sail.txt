Sail

This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
Blame it on my ADD, baby

This is how an angel cries
Blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD, baby

Sail

Sail

Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself (myself, myself)
Blame it on my ADD, baby

Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD, baby

La la la la la
La la la la la, oh

La la la la la
La la la la la, oh

Sail with me into the dark
Sail
Sail with me into the dark
Sail
Sail with me into the dark
