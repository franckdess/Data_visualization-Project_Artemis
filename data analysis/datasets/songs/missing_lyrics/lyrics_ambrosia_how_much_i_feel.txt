I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I had been untrue
But if you think that we'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but I'll break away from you
Well, just give me the sign and I will be gone, yeah

That's how much I feel feel for you, baby
How much I need, I need your touch
How much I live I live for your lovin'
That's how much, that's how much
That's how much, that's how much

I sleep alone, and late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness that seems to be leavin' me, oh no
I'd give it all and then I'd give some more
If you would only love me like you had before
Take hold of my hand all will be forgiven


So you try, try to stay in the middle
And then you cry, well you cry just a little
Then you both realize just how foolish you've been
And you try to make amends but you're better off as friends
Cause that's how much, that's how much
That's how much, that's how much

How's your life been goin' on?
I've got a wife now years we've been goin' strong
Oh no there's just something that I've got to say
Sometimes when we make love I still can see your face
Just try to recall when we were as one
