Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn’t build nothin’ overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can’t see that
Now from top to bottom, they see that we did that
(Yes) It’s so true that
(Yes) We been through it
(Yes) We got real shit
(Yes) See, baby

We've been too strong for too long
And I can’t be without you baby
And I’ll be waitin’ up until you get home
'Cause I can’t sleep without you, baby (Ohh)
Anybody who’s ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin’ can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby, yeah

I got a question for ya (See, I already know the answer)
But still I wanna ask you, will you lie? (No)
Make me cry? (No)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is on the up and up
(Yes) I’ll be faithful
(Yes) I’m for real
(Yes) And with us you’ll always know the deal

We've been too strong for too long
And I can’t be without you, baby (Ohh)
And I’ll be waitin’ up until you get home
'Cause I can’t sleep without you, baby (Ohh, ohh)
If anybody who’s ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin’ can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby, yeah

See, this is real talk, I’mma always stay (No matter what)
Good or bad (Thick and thin)
Right or wrong (All day, every day, hey)
Now if you’re down on love or don’t believe this ain’t for you
(No, this ain’t for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it’s true (C’mon, c’mon, c’mon)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (Hands up)
Fellas tell your lady she’s the one
Fellas tell your lady she’s the one
Oh, put your hands up (Hands up)
Ladies let him know he’s got you locked
Look him right in his eyes and tell him

We've been too strong for too long
And I can’t be without you, baby
Can’t be without you, baby
I’ll be waitin’ up until you get home
'Cause I can’t sleep without you, baby
Oh, if anybody who’s ever loved you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin’ can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby
