Yeah
Yeah, uh-huh

C'mon boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where this at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?

If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

The time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world!)
No hesitating
Grab a boy (then grab a girl!)
Time is waiting
(We only got four minutes to save the world!)
No hesitating
(We only got four minutes, heh a-four minutes)

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri... (Hey!) ..Ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri... (Hey!) ..Ma donna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
