We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken
It's easier to hide

Looking at you, holding my breath
For once in my life, I'm scared to death
I'm taking a chance, letting you inside

We're feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky, under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time

The world that I see inside you
Waiting to come to life
Waking me up to dreaming
Reality in your eyes

Looking at you, holding my breath
For once in my life, I'm scared to death
I'm taking a chance, letting you inside

We're feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky, under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong but I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time
(For the first time, for the first time)

We're crashing into
Into the unknown
We're lost in this
But it feels like home

Feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky that's under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time

(For the first time, for the first time)
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
(For the first time, for the first time)
Like being in love, to feel for the first time
(For the first time)
