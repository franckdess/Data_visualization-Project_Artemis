Chaka, Chaka, Chaka, Chaka Khan
Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan
Chaka Khan, let me rock you
Let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you
Let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, let me feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
Do you feel for me, the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
Let me take you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm
Chaka, I'll make you more than just a physical dream
I wanna rock you, Chaka
Baby, cause you make me wanna scream
Let me rock you, rock you
Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that i got for you, baby
Makes me wanna sing
CHORUS:
I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

Feel for you
Baby, baby, when I lay with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
CHORUS
Yes sir, one more time
Say yeah
I feel for you (I think I love you)
I feel for you (I, I, I think I love you)
