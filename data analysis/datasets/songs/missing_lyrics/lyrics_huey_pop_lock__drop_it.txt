Toot that thang up, mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock, drop it for me maybe we can roll, OH!

Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it

Tonight it's gon' be some changes, no actin sadity
So stop actin and get it clappin cause I'm knowin you feelin me
Yeah you cute, but don't let that *shit* go to yo' head
Cause what this cutie won't do, pimpin another one will
You prepured rockin a skirt and ya heels so tall
And we ain't wit none of that trickin but our bills so tall
I been peepin you fo' a while and you throwin it back
If you lookin fo you a balla, we got dough in da back
Look yo' color carmello brown and your skin so smooth
I'm havin fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undacover freak, you probably thinking da same
I'm seein light up on yo face, because you peepin my chain
And I ain't tryin put you out thurr, as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way, just say you did it for me
And yeah, you probably ROLL wit me cause it's money in my pockets
So until THEN, I gotta see you pop lock and drop it

Toot that thang up, mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock, drop it for me maybe we can roll, OH!

Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it

I ain't gotta be yo' man, but I really wouldn't mind
We ain't gotta talk again, I'm jus tryin have a time
If you a balla, pull a stack out, and slap her on da ayyy!
Pop lockin cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mami get low, give a space let her sweat
The club turnin to hoolas cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall, lil' mama showin her thong
The broad, freakin herself, it's tellin me that it's on
You ready then we can roll I'm tellin you we can go
I'm thinkin if I can handle it the way you make it roll
You groovin and speedin up, you right in between us
If you a strip-teaser, then baby don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin but my vision gettin clearer
You movin that thang around as if you practice in the mirror
"She doin a new, dance," what the next man said
I'm like, "Naw, she just pop lockin on a headstand"

Toot that thang up, mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock, drop it for me maybe we can roll, OH!

Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it

Make it roll to the left (left), roll to the right (right)
Pop lock and drop it get low aight
Make it roll to the left (left), roll to the right (right)
Pop lock and drop it get low aight
It ain't trickin if you got it, we got it but I ain't givin
Just bounce it and roll wit it and maybe you roll wit us
It ain't trickin if you got it, we got it and I ain't givin
Just bounce it and roll wit it and maybe you roll wit us
Pop lock and drop it, now pop lock and drop it fo' me
Pop lock and drop it, say pop lock and drop it
What's yo name girl? Neva mind, neva mind
Do ya thang girl, fire you ain't neva lied
What's yo name girl? Neva mind, neva mind
Do you thang girl, fire you ain't neva lied, oh!
