I would've given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I have
But if you want I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again (Try)
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know, oh

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again
(Try to love again, try to love again)
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
Ohh

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
When it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

Ohh, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
Try to love again
