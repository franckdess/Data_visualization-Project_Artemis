Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursin' my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway

One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes

One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they're gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em oh, oh, oh
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

My ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make ‘em oh, oh, oh
They won’t let go
Ex’s and the oh, oh, oh’s they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make ‘em oh, oh, oh
They won’t let go
Ex’s and oh’s
