Up a lazy river where the old mill run
Meets a lazy river in the noonday sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
And you throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes to bright new morning, we can loaf along
Blue skies above and everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we can be, oh
Oh a river with me
Up a lazy river where the old mill run
Meets a lazy river in the noonday sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
And you throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me
(Dream a dream of me!)
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes to bright new mornin', we can loaf along
Blue skies above and everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we can be, oh
The river
Lazy river, the lazy river, the lazy river, 

Up a lazy river where the old mill run
Meets a lazy river in the noonday sun
And you linger in the shade of a kind old tree
And you throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me
Up a lazy river, robin's song
Wakes to bright new morning, we can loaf along
Blue skies, above, and everyone's, in love
Up a lazy river, mmh, crazy, river
Lazy river, lazy river, lazy river
And up a lazy river where the old mill run
And you meets a lazy river in the noonday sun
And you linger in the shade of a kind old tree
And you throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
And he wakes to bright new morning, we can loaf along
Blue skies, above, everyone, in love
The river, is crazy, lazy, river
Hazy river, crazy river, lazy river
And up a lazy river where the old mill run
And you meets a lazy river in the noonday sun
And you linger in the shade of a kind old tree
And you throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes to bright new morning, and we can loaf along
Blue skies, above, everyone, in love
The river, crazy, lazy, river
River, crazy lazy river, boy
And up a lazy river, -er -er
River river, mmh, boy
River, river, river, river
And you throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes to bright new morning, we can loaf along
Blue skies, above, everyone, in love
Baby, river, crazy, lazy, river
It's crazy, baby, river
Up a lazy river with me!
