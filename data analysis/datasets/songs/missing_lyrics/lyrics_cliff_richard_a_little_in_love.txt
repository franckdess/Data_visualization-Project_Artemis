It's been so long, you say you've had fun
And you've been happy with the things you've done
Now you feel strange and a little unreal
Well I can understand the way you feel
You're just a little in love (just a little)
You're just a little in love (just a little)
Well I can see what's happening to you
You feel alone, but it's just not true
And there's one thing you ought to know
Whoo, I need you so
I'm just a little in love (just a little)
I'm just a little in love (just a little)
You say you're willing to learn
You need a friend, a friend who will help you
'Cause you're just a little in love, oh yeah
A little in love, you are
A little in love with someone, you're just like me
Like me, you're in love, oh yeah
A little in love
You know sometime you look somewhere
You're not alone but there's no one there
No one to turn to, no one to see
The way you're feeling, you're just like me
You're just a little in love (just a little)
You're just a little in love (just a little)
Now you say you're willing to learn
But you need a friend, a friend who will help you
'Cause you're just a little in love, oh yeah
A little in love, you are
A little in love with someone, you're just like me
Like me, you're in love, oh yeah
A little in love
You're in love, oh yeah
A little in love, you are
A little in love with someone, you're just like me
Oh, you're in love, you're in love, you're in love
A little in love with someone, you're just like me
Like me, you're in love
A little in love, you are
A little in love with someone, you're just like me
