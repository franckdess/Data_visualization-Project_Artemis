That's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go
You're just a fool
You say that I'm number one
And you'll always be true
How can this be?
You say you've fallen in love
You don't know what it means
But look around and you will see
Broken promises and jealousy
Is that what you should want for us to be?
One time lover turned enemy
But that's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go
All I can say is that
I'm looking no further ahead than today
Too young for this game
On the road to forever we don't know the way
So just forget about eternity
All the promises we just can't keep
Look down any street that's what you'll see
I don't wanna bring you to your knees
But that's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go
That's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go
