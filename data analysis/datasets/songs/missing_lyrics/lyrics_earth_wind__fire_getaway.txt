So you say you tried
But you just can't find the pleasure
People around you givin' you pressure
Try to resist all the hurt that's all
Around you
If you taste it, it will haunt you
So come, take me by the hand
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Getaway
Watch for the signs
That lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way
Into what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
So come, take me by the hand
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can getaway
Getaway
Lay awake every night
Till the sun comes up in the morning
Nothing exciting, it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
To your road, you just don't doubt it
So come, take me by the hand
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Getaway
