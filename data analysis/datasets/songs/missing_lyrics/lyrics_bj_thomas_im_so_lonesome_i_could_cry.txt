Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a night so long
When time goes crawlin' by?
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a fallin' star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Yeah I-I could cry-eye-eye
I could cry-eye, eye-eye-eye, I-I could cry-eye
I could cry-eye, oh-oh-oh-oh
I-I could cry, I could cry
