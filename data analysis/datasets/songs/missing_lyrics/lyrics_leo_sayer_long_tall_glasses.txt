I was travellin' down the road feelin' hungry and cold
I saw a sign sayin' "Food and Drinks for Everyone"
So naturally, I thought I would take me a look inside
I saw so much food there was water coming from my eyes
Yeah, there was ham and there was turkey, there was caviar
And long tall glasses with wine up to y'are
Then somebody grabbed me, threw me out of my chair
Said, "Before you can eat, you gotta dance like Fred Astaire"
You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance, I can't dance!
I am a man of the road, a hobo by name
I don't seek entertainment, just poultry and game
But if it's all the same to you then yes, I will try my hand
If you were hungry as me then I'm sure you will understand
Hmm, now wait a minute, of course I can dance
Of course I can dance, I'm sure I can dance
I'm sure I can dance, I can dance
I can dance, I really hit the floor, ah, it feels good
Look at me dancin'!
I did a Two Step, Quick Step and a Bossanova
A little Victor Sylvester and a Rudy Valentino
You should have seen me moving right across the floor
Hand me down my tuxedo, next week I'm coming back for more
I can dance, oh yes, I can dance
Look at me dance on the floor movin'
I feel good, I can dance, I can dance
I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance
