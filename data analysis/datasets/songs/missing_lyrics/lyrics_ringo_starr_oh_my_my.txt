One, two, three, four!

I phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
He said, "come on over."
I said, "do I have to?"
My knees started shaking, my wrist started aching
When my doctor said to me:

Ooh my my, oh my my, can you boogie, can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
Oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive

The head nurse she blew in, just like a tornado
When they started dancing, i jumped off the table
I felt myself healing and as i was leaving
This is what they said to me:


Now if you should slow down and you're feeling low down
Don't call up your doctor, just grab you a partner
It's what you've been missing, I've got your prescription
That boogie woogie remedy


"oh my my, oh my my, watch me boogie, watch me slide
Oh my my, (ow!) Oh my my, born to boogie, born to slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, oo-wee, boogie, oo-wee, aye. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, play that boogie, play that slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, love that boogie, love that slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, oh, my boogie, oh, my slide. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on, baby, come on now. (can you boogie)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on, baby, I'm willing to die. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on, baby, come on, try. (can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my."
