Calling all cars

I never thought that
I could feel this way
You came around
And brought about a change
In me

I was a typical guy
You came along and blew my mind
You were running fast
I was running slow
Everybody said that it would not work
Love came
And set me free
You were standing there to rescue me
Love caught it
We thought
Why can't we be in love?
Well

Why?
It's no crime
If I'm guilty of love
Let me do my time
Why?
It's no crime
Everybody needs love
And baby
So do I

You never thought love
Came so easily
No doubt about it
Never in your dreams
No way

You were a typical girl
You came along and changed my world
I walk slow
You walk fast
Everybody said that it could not last
Love came inside of me
Never knew how good
Our love could be
Love caught it
We thought
Why can't we be in love?
Well


I've spent half a lifetime
Waiting for someone
You say
I know it was you
They don't recommend it
I don't understand it
I've been reprimanded
'Cause I'm in love with you
Calling all cars

Why, why
So do I
So do I
So do I
So do I
Oh so do I

And baby
Why?
