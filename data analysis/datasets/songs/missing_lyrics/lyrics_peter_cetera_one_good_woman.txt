I am so in love with you
I just can't deny it
Everybody knows I can't deny it
Everybody knows
You can read me like a book
Just like a fortune teller
Everybody needs a fortune teller
Telling you the very truth
You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do
You bring out the best in me
With love and understanding
Anytime I need some understanding
You are always there
And if I ever lose my way
You're always there to guide me
Anyone can see you're here inside me
Anyone can see it
You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do
You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do
This is our time, we have it all
We have a way of knowing if we're heading for a fall
We'll work it out and get it right
And when I get home to you
You're such a sight for my poor eyes
This is our time, we have it all
When I come home at night
You're such a sight for my poor eyes
You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do
You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do
