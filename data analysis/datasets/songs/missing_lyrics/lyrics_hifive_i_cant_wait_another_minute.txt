You know
I've been waiting so long or this chance
Can we talk alone?
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute

Little lady
You look so fine
Can't turn my eyes away
So much I wanna say
And tonight I wanna make you mine
We'll turn the lights down low
And dance so very slow
I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time
Oh, no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight

'Cuz I've been holding back what I feel
Love's so real
But I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute
'Cuz I've been holding back all I feel
I'm for real
'Cuz I can't wait another minute
I can't wait another minute for your love
Your love
No
No, no, baby

Sweet lady
Don't you look away
I don't mean to make you shy
But we haven't got much time
Tonight, I know just what to say, yeah
I'll love your cares away
And you and I will find a way
You know that there's a possibility
That we'll never get this chance once again
Oh, no
So tell me what to do
For the love of you tonight
Baby, tonight

Your love
Oh, yeah

I know that we don't know each other well
But I can't believe I'm wasting your time
Oh, no
So tell me what to do for the love of you
Tonight
Tonight, baby

Don't make me wait another minute
Oh no, baby
For your love
