Tell me why
Everything  we had is nothing, nothing‚ nothing
All  I did
Was try to give you all my lovin'‚ lovin'‚ lovin'
Baby girl, you did me wrong
And  you can say I should have known
But  it's time to play a different song
And now I'm gone
Why  do you think you have to lie
I can see the truth right in your eyes
Girl, you must have lost your mind
What did you expect me to do
After  all that we've been through
Girl‚ I'm wasting no more time
Tell me
(Tell me)
Who's gonna kiss you like I do
Tell me why
Everything we had is nothing, nothing, nothing
All I did
Was try to give you all my lovin'‚ lovin', lovin'
Baby girl, you did me wrong
And you can say I should have known
But it's time to play a different song
And now I'm gone
Why do you think you have to lie
I can see the truth right in your eyes
Girl, you must have lost your mind
What did you expect me to do
After all that we've been through
Girl, I'm wasting no more time
Tell me
Who's gonna love you like I do
Who's gonna kiss you like I do
(Tell me)
Who's gonna kiss you like I do
