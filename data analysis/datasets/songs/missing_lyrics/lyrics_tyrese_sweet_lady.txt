Oh, give it
Be my sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Oh, I want you to be my lady, lady
Oh, babe

Sweet lady, would you be my
Sweet love for, for a lifetime?
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me

Da, da, da, da
My sweet lady, baby
La, la, la, la

Now any other day, I would play it cool
But I can't now 'cause I want you
See I'm hooked on how you flex your style
And I wanna talk for a little while
I never really seen your type
But I must admit that I kinda like
So, maybe, if you have the time
We could talk about you bein' my

Sweet lady (Would you be my)
Would you be my (Sweet love for)
Sweet love for a lifetime? (A lifetime)

Now on the regular, I would waste time but I don't want to
'Cause you're so damn fine
And I heard that you were taken
But that don't have to stop you from making
Late night phone calls on the telephone
About your fantasies and ways to get it on
When you need me I will be
There for you my sweet lady

Sweet lady (Would you be my)

Say you will be my baby (Say you will be my lady)
Say you will be my lady
I’ve got to have all your love
So I won’t even front (I won’t front, no)
Just say you'll give it to me
Don't wanna hear the maybe's oh no no no
