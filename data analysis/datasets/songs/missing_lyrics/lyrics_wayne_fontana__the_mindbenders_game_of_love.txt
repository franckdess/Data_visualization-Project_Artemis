And the purpose of a woman is to love a man
So come on, baby

It started long ago in the Garden of Eden
When Adam said to Eve
Baby, you're for me
So come on, baby
Let's start today
Come on, baby
Let's play
The game of love, love
La, la, la, la, la love
Come on, baby
'Cause the time is right
Love your daddy with all your might
Put your arms around me
Hold me tight
Play the game of love
