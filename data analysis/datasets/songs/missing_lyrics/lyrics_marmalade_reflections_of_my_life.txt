The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
The greetings of people in trouble
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
Oh my sorrows
Sad tomorrows
Take me back to my own home
Oh my crying (Oh my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back
To my own home
The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
{Instrumental}
I'm changing, arranging
I'm changing
I'm changing everything
Everything around me
The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
The world is
A bad place
A bad place
A terrible place to live
Oh but I don't want to die ...
Oh my sorrows
Sad tomorrows
Take me back to my own home
Oh my crying (Oh my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back
To my own home
