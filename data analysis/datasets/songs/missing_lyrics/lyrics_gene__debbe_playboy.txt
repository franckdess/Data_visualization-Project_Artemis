Hey boy, to me you're just a playboy
Never mean a word you say, boy
I'm so afraid you'll go away and leave me lonely
Why girl do you believe a lie girl
Why can't you see that you're my girl
Believe me when I say to you
I love you only
And never knew that love could hurt me like this
Till you came along with your kiss
Then I fell under your spell
Knowing quite well that you would only hurt me
Gee girl why can't I make you see girl
Just what you mean to me girl
Then you would know I'd never go away without you
Oh boy I wish that I could know boy
If what you say is so boy
Then I would never care what they all say about you
I never knew that love could hurt me like this
Till you came along with your kiss
Then I fell knowing quite well
That someone would tell you I would only hurt you
Hey now does it matter what they say
Gonna love you anyway now
If you and I would fight together
I know we'll find love
