Chorus:
Oh Sweet Pea come on and dance with me
Come on, come on, come on and dance with me
Oh Sweet Pea won't you be my girl
Won't you, won't you, won't you be my girl
I went to a dance just the other night
I saw a girl there she was out of sight
I asked a friend of mine who she could be
He said that her friends just call her Sweet Pea
Chorus
I walked on over and asked her to dance
Thinkin' maybe later we would make a romance
But every guy there was thinkin' like me
I had to stand in line to get a dance with Sweet Pea
Chorus
I finally got to whisper sweet words in her ear
Suggest her that we outta get away from there
We took a little walk I held he close to me
And underneath the stars I said to Sweet Pea
Oh Sweet Pea I love you can't you see
Love you, love you, love you can't you see
Oh Sweet Pea won't you be my girl
