Ooooh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Oh yeah

Well, I tried to tell you so (Yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Come on)
Return of the Mack (Oh my God)
You know that I'll be back (Here I am)
Return of the Mack (Once again)
Return of the Mack (Top of the world)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)

So, I'm back up in the game (Hustling snow)
Running things to keep my swing (All night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh)
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Hold on)
Return of the Mack (Don't you know)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)
Return of the Mack (Oh, little girl)
Return of the Mack (Once my pearl)
Return of the Mack (Up and down)
You know that I'll be back (Round and round)

Ahh, Mark, stop lying about your big break
For God sake, I need a real man, uh
(The return of the mack, aoww) stop putting me down
Stop putting me down

You lied to me
Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack (It is)
Return of the Mack (Come on)
Return of the Mack (Oh, my God)
You know that I'll be back (Here I am)
Return of the Mack (Once again)
Return of the Mack (Top of the world)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
You know that I'll be back (Don't you know)
Return of the Mack (Here it is)
Return of the Mack (Hold on)
Return of the Mack (Be strong)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)
Return of the Mack (My little baby)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
Return of the Mack (Up and down)
You know that I'll be back (Round and round)
