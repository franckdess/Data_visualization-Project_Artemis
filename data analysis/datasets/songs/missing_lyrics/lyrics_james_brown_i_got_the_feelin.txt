I got the feelin'!
Baby, baby
I got the feelin'!

You don't know what you do to me
People are heavy, down in misery
Hey, yeah, alright
Hey, hey, good lord
I got the feelin' baby
Baby, sometimes I'm down
My heart, I'm around the town
I'm level with the ground, baby
I said level with the ground
Well baby, you treat me bad
No, no. I know no
You don't mean it now
Sometimes I roam
But, I'll be coming back home
Sometimes, I seem to be fly
I just don't know when to say, "bye bye"
Hey baby, baby
I got that feelin' baby
I have it, alright
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Come on now
Come on now
Oh, oh, oh...
