Bad Boy
We ain't gon' stop

Now it's Sean on the hot track, melt like it's hot wax
Put it out, all the stores, bet you could shop that (that's right)
Leave a nigga with a hot hat, fronting like
Bad boy ain't got tracks (nigga stop that)
There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)
Did fed time, outta town pie-flipper
Turn Cristal into a crooked-I sipper
Everybody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in bad boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)
I'm through with bein a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her
Mase wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over a steel V-neck
Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

Don't push us, 'cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin', not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

Broken glass everywhere
If it ain't about the money, Puff, I just don't care (that's right)
I'm that goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys
Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I
Mase, can you please stop smoking la-la?
Puff, why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high
I be out in Jersey, puffin' Hershey
Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby
Though I'm never drug free when I'm the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna: rock the rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)
I'm like, "Damn, how these niggas got that trife?
Used to be my man, how he gonna plot on my wife?"
Do you think he snake me 'cause he hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hatin' Degree? (Ahaha!)

Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin'

Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)
Where your chicks at? (yeah)
Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'mma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)
Don't knock me 'cause you're boring
I'm record sales soaring, straight touring
Simply a lot of men be wantin' to hear me
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)
We spend cheese, in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black, and famous, with money hangin' out the anus
And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)
And got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet

Don't push us, 'cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin', not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah

I get the feeling sometime, it make me wonder
Why you wanna take us under
Why you wanna take us under?
I get the feeling sometime, it make me wonder
Why you wanna take us under
Why you wanna take us under?

Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin'
Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin'
Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no
I got to keep on movin'
Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
