The flowers you gave me are just about to die
When I think about
What could've been
Makes me want to cry
The sweet words you whispered didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold
What could've been on a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere
Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all
At all

How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night
