She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this
