G-G-Giving you, giving you
G-G-Giving you, giving you
G-G-Giving you, giving you
Here we go
1, 2, 3, 4

Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why you keep dissing me
Poor little me
And why you have a change of heart
Then turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me
But don't you know
I can be a trip
I can make things hard
But baby I believe that you still got a heart
That's why I try to stop myself before I start
'Cause I can make it tough
I can make it rough
But I won't

Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out
Baby, work it on
Work it on out
(Work, work, work)
Baby, work it on
Work it on out
(Work, work, work)
Oooh, oooooooooh

Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me
Poor little me
When you knew all the time
That you could've been with your homegirl
Loving and a kissing on me
Sweet little me
But don't you know
If you wanna be a man
You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one
And nothing in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work
If you take away the hurt from the heart


(Oh) I can be a trip
But I choose not to
(Oh, oh) Deep inside of you
I think there's still good in you, boy
(Oh) Don't give me no reason not to trust you
(Oh, oh) Just take the benefit
Don't give me no lip
And I'll be sweet to you

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I'll be giving you a minute or two
To try and work it out
(I wanna work it, baby)
I'll be giving you a minute or two
To try and work it out
(But don't you take too long, baby)

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
