Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song they're playing on the radio
(Let's sway) while colour lights up your face
(Let's sway) sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

(Let's dance) for fear your grace should fall
(Let's dance) for fear tonight is all
(Let's sway) you could look into my eyes
(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall, into my arms and tremble like a flower

(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)

(Let's dance) put on your red shoes and dance the blues
(Let's dance) to the song we're playing
(Let's sway)
(Let's sway) under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

(Let's dance)
(Let's...)
(Let's...)
(Let's...)
(Let's sway)
(Let's...)
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
(Let's dance)
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
(Let's dance)
