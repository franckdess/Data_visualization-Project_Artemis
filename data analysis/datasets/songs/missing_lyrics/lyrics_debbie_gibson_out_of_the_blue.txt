Without you
Without you
I always thought that
Everything was fine
Without you
Never knowing you'd be mine
Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was
What love was

I need you, I need you
And every day I love you
More and more
Without you
I know what it's all for
Suddenly I see you there
And everything's okay
Don't know why I feel this way

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was
What love was
Here with you

We are together now
Never take my heart away
All the love I found
Is here to stay
(out of the blue)

It's like a dream come true
I never thought
I'd fall in love with you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought

Here with you
Out of the, out of the
Out of the clear blue
Oh, it's like a dream come true
I never thought
I never thought
Out of the blue
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
I'd fall in love with you
Out of the, out of the
Out of the, out of the clear blue
