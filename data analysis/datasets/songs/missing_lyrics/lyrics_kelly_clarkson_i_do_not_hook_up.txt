Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasing your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say...

'Cause I feel the distance
Between us
Could be over with a snap of your finger
Oh, no

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
'Cause you don't wanna miss out
