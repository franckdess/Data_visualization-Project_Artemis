Need I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions
Are something we don't share?
I don't want to be sitting here
Trying to convince you
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go
We can not live together
We can not live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start
Every time that I look at you
I can see the future
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turnin' upside down
Throwing it all away
Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?
Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go
Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be
But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey...
We're throwing it all away
Just a throwing it all away
Just a throwing it all away
