If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
I'm not saying I want to change you
I don't want to rearrange you
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
From the very first moment I saw you
It's been a different world
From the very first moment I saw you
It's been such a different world
I seem to be a little bit stronger
Each moment seems just a little
Little bit longer
The missing links and little kinks
Have never been found and uncurled
But you're still the same
You're like a frozen flame
Well it sure seems a shame
You let me make love to you
But you won't let me touch you
When I leave you I'm going someplace
That I've never been before
When I leave you I'm going someplace
That I've never been before
Reach out and touch me
Why don't you reach out and touch me
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you?
