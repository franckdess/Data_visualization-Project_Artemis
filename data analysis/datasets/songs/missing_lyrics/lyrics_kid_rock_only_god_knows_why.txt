I've been sittin' here tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what they deserve

Still I ain't seen mine
No, I ain't seen mine
I've been givin', just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line
So, I think I'll keep walkin' with my head held high
I keep movin' on and only God knows why
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why
Only God knows why, why, why
Only God knows why

Take me to the river, ey
Won't you take me to the river, hey, hey, yeah
