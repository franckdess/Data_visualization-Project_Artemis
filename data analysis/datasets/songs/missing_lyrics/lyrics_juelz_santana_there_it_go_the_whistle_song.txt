San-tana, aight
It's Dipset, bitch!
There it go, baby don't stop now
There it go, baby don't stop now

There it go
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinking 'bout getting at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ay, girl – you make – my whistle blow
There it go, bring it here baby
There it go, bring it here baby

Top down and I'm at it again
It's hot now and I'm at it to win, you heard me?
Who want it with me? Nobody want it with me
Oh, I'm so fly, oh, mami come and get me
Sit it down, back up, bring it on back up
Move it 'til you feel something hard on your back, ugh
There it go, if you want it, come and get it
I ain't kidding I'm with it, here it go, go
So girl – let me – see you get low
There it go, yeah, just like that
Move the thang like a boomerang and come right back
There it go, I don't need to ask I proceed to grab her
Chicks love my G'd up swagger, there it go

There it go
Damn, shorty look good and I'm thinking 'bout getting at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ay, girl – you make – my whistle blow
There it go, bring it here baby, come on
There it go, bring it here baby, come on
Ay, girl – let me – see you get low
There it go, set it down baby
There it go, set it down baby
There it go, it's Dipset
There it go, aight, aight, aight
There it go, it's Dipset
There it go, aight, aight

I got to get it, I'm so hot terrific
So not fair to the other guys that's in it
I know not my limit cause no sky's the limit
'til then I'm doing my, doing my, doing my thing
So baby keep moving your, moving your, moving your thing
And that'll keep you in the, you in the, you in the ring (or maybe not)
Ay, girl – you make – me want to know
You do it like a pro, lil' lady
If so bring it here, let it show, lil' lady, there it go
Let's go, lil' lady, to the crib
To the tele, you know, lil' lady
Um, yes girl, um, yes we can have a cum-fest, girl
'til the sun sets girl, girl
But first I gotta get you undressed girl
So take off them clothes and get undressed girl
