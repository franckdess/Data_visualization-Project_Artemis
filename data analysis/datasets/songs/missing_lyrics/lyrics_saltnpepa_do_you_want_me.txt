Dumb it down for I take it
You know I had to custom make it
I'm not accustomed to the fake shit
All studed all aces
My drink straight never chase it
My bank straight never changes
You know I'm money motivated
For the fortune fuck the fame shit
New world new religion
New religion new lies
New lies new heights
Shit I had to sacrifice
You always gotta pay the price
Snake eyes off the dice
Pure white gotta dice
The white taking black lives
I'm on the rise, Enterprise
Warp speed, Energized
Bee hive, Wats riot
Fe fi, Little giant
Change is so, terrifying
(Haha)
I'm stealing lives, Micheal Myers
From the plug twice, Like I'm Plies
I dish it out, Like it's pie
I'm Bo Jack, 85
The lines im laying across your mind might cross the line
(Im dope at times)
The shit I perscribe can't be defined youll never find
(These type of lines)
Tilique young Ronald Reagan
Hollywood's secret agent
They made old Ronald Reagan
You know they gotta custom make it

Ya stand down
(Stand down)
Ya Hands down
(Hands down)
Ya stand down
(Stand down)
Ya Hands down
(Bah Bah bah)
Ya Man down

My pockets on protein
I bulk up
I push the cds to these teens
Like coca
La Cosa Nostra
I might start my own mafioso
I'm off the wall now they want me on posters
I did what I'm supposed to
I cop the black on black Benz
Then I black out
Heater gon wax all these kids like a candle
I pack the pellets like pac-man
Im Pacquiao
Think it's a scandal
T.E.A.M. thanking everyone around me
I see my city surround me
I see the bitch pretty then doubt me
She see I sit pretty now she bout me
I want no one around me
Fuck what they planning
I'm just tryna fend for the family
I hit up Panthers I'm tanning
I crush the glass like I'm sanding
Did this for Minne, Molly and my Granny
I deserve a grammy
Lyndon B. killing off Kennedys
Friend of my enemy
Been a friend to my enemy
I'm befriended  my enemies
Knife out my back
You should see what they did to me
Cut from the the chain like I'm Django
Trapped in the dirt tryna blend in like Rango
Scratched off the right 5 like it's bingo
I stack the chips high like it's pringles
No more hidden angles
So many fake niggas in my ear this year
Almost started to hear 'em
So many snake niggas in my rear this year
Almost crashed had my eyes on the mirror
Swag swerve power steer
I got merch got the gear
Birds chirping in his ear
I gotta get this shit clear
I gotta do all this shit for my peers
Have no fear

Ya stand down
(Stand down)
Ya Hands down
(Hands down)
Ya stand down
(Stand down)
Ya Hands down
(Bah Bah bah)
Ya Man down

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
