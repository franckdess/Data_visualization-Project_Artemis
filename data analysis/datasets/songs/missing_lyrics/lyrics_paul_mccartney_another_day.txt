Everyday, she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day

At the office where the papers grow, she takes a break
Drinks another coffee, and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day

Du du du du du du, it's just another day
Du du du du du du, it's just another day

So sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in her apartment, she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Stay, don't stand around
And he comes, and he stays, but he leaves the next day
So sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

As she posts another letter to the sound of five
People gather around her and she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day

Du du du du du du, it's just another day
Du du du du du du, it's just another day

So sad, so sad
Sometimes she feels so sad
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell
Stay, don't stand around
And he comes, and he stays, but he leaves the next day
So sad
Sometimes she feels so sad

Everyday she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day

Du du du du du du, it's just another day
Du du du du du du, it's just another day
