Rainy night I'm all alone
Sitting here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold cold sweat
Thinking about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I've gotta know, do you feel the same
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

Don't worry baby
Ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
If your whole world is shakin'
And you feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you
Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side
And you might as well try and stop the rain
Or stand in the track of a runaway train
You just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be
Come on let's finish what you started with me
