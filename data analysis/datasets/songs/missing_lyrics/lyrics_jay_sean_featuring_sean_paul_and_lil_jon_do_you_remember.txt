Hey! Jay Sean, hey! (Mmh, yeah)

Lil Jon, ah!
This one right here (Alright)
Is for all the ladies (Alright)
Ladies, who want to take it back (Oh no)
Holler at 'em, Jay!

I've been thinking about you
And how we used to be, yeah
Back when, it didn't have to end
We can start again

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time
Let's make new memories
(Let's go!)

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
All of the times we had
Do you remember?

So long, since you've been missing
It's good to see you again
How are you? How ya doin'?
And how about me? Don't let this happen again
(Let's go!)

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay

Bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
When I was still your number one
Well it might seem far-fetched baby girl, but it can't be done
I've got this feeling fire blazing and it's hot just like the sun
Know you feel it too, my girl
Just freeze up, may the good vibes run
Girl take a sip of the champagne
Take a lil trip down my lane my girl
While you know every night you'll feel alright
Look, I tell you this girl atta my world
Don't change, I'mma not rearrange that girl
I'mma tell you straight this atta my world
How many years do you want? Come kiss this, I know you miss this

That's what I heard
That's what I heard (Mmh...)
That's what I heard
Word, girl (Tonight)

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day (Don't waste another day, no) (Hey!)
Just you and me tonight (Hey!)
Everything will be okay (Hey!)
If it's alright with you (Hey!)
Then it's alright with me (Hey!)
Baby let's take this time (Hey!)
Let's make new memories
(Let's go!)

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
All of the times we had (All of the times)
Do you remember? (Hey!)
