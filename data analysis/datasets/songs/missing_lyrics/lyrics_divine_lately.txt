Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Have you ever felt a breeze hit your heart
Like the wind was blowing it apart (blowing it apart)
As you're spinning like a merry-go-round
Indications of a storm touching down
I wish that I could weather any storm
But I guess it was a heart break from the norm
Was a day I will always remember
The saddest day in sweet November
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
(Watching the days go by, oh)
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away (sitting away)
Watching the days go by (watching the days go by)
Baby I'm on my knees, praying to God help me please
Bring my baby back, right back to me, mmm
If lovin' you is right, then I don't wanna go wrong
So I drown myself with tears
Sittin' here, singin' another sad love song
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Lately I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missing you babe, missing you everyday
Lately I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missing you babe, missing you everyday
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
Lately (I've been watching you)
