You must be a special lady
(Billy, you singin' first tenor or second?
Naw, Harry, I'm singin' second man)
And a very exciting girl
(Now bring that bass out, man
Hey man, I'll bring it out a little bit more)
You gotta be a special lady
(Let's get down on some harmony, come on!)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
Somehow I knew it would be you
To change my gray skies to blue
And it was strange when you called my name
Ever since that day I haven't been the same, ooh
Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a sudden you slipped up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind
A sweet special lady
And a very exciting girl (ooh, so exciting)
You gotta be a special lady (what a lady)
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
I was like a song so out of key
Then you came and gave my soul a melody
Thanks to you, for pullin' me through
I've always lost but now I win with you
Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a sudden you slipped up from behind
Pop (pop) went the reason in my mind
(You must be a special lady) you're a lady
(And a very exciting girl) so exciting, woo
(You gotta be a special lady) you're a lady
('Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world)
Oh, sittin' on top of the world
(Sittin' on top of the world)
(Sittin' on top of the world)
Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine
Then all of a suddenly you slipped up from behind
Pop (Pop) went the reason in my mind
You must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
You gotta be a special lady
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
You must be a special lady (you're a lady)
And a very exciting girl (you're a lady)
You gotta be a special lady (get down Billy Brown) all right
'Cause you got me sittin' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world
You must be a special lady (woo)
And a very exciting girl (oh girl)
You gotta be a special lady
