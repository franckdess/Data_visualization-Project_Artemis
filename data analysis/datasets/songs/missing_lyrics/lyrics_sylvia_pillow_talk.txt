Ay... ay... ay... yi!
Hey, baby, let me stay;
I don't care what your friends are 'bout to say... ah-ah...
What your friends all say is fine
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine...
Ooh, you can't find love on a one-way street;
It takes two to tango, takes two to even compete... oh, yeah...
So boy, just put that stop sign down
And let's get together before the day runs us down...
I'm pleading to you now:
Hey, baby, let me try
To be the one who's gonna light your fire... ha-ha...
What your friends all say is fine
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine...
Ooh, I don't wanna see you be no fool;
What I'm teachin' you tonight, boy, you'll never learn it in school... oh, no...
So friends who tell me wrong from right
I'll ask to borrow their man some cold and lonely night...
Ooh... hey, baby, let me be
The one who turns you on from A to Z... ha-ha...
What your friends all say is fine
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine...
Ooh, baby...
Ooh, baby, la-la-la, la-la-la-la...
Ah... would you, baby?
Would you, baby? La-la-la, la-la-la-la...
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay...
Uno momento poquito...
Uno momento poquito! Ay-ay-ay-ay...
Nice, daddy... nice, daddy... nice, daddy...
Ay-ay-ay-ay...
Oh, my God...
