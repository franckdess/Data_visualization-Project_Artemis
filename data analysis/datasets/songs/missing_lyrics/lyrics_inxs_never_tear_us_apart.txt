Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

I, I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I,I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

I, I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart

I, I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

You was standing
I was there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

I was standing
You were there
