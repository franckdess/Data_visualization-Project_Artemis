Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so

Say it isn't so painful
To tell me that you're dissatisfied
The last time I asked you, I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see em' goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more

(Say it)
Tell me what you want
Yeah, I'll do it, Baby, I promise right now
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground?

I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide Away, goodbye
But if there's a doubt, maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why you have to say it isn't so

(It Isn't So)
Now Say It isn't So
(It isn't so)
Now Say It isn't so
(It isn't so)
Oh, Say it isn't so
(It isn't so)

(Say it)
We like to be the strangers at the party
Two rebels in a shell
(Say it)
You like to move with the best of them
You know we, move so well

Don't need someone to lean on
I know why there's an open door
But if I'm faced with being replaced
I want you even more
So baby, say it isn't so


Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so

Why you wanna go
Do you have to say
You wanna go?
Ooh, oh Baby say it isn't

(Say it isn't)
Say, Say, Say it isn't
(Say it isn't)
So
(So, Say it isn't)
Why you have to say it isn't
(Say it isn't)
So
(Say it isn't)
So
(So, Say it isn't)
I know its so hard for you
(Say it isn't)
So hard
(Say it isn't)
Don't say it, babe
(So, say it isn't)
There must be some other way
Don't have to
(Say it isn't)
Some other way
(so, say it isn't)
Ha, you don't have to say
(Say it isn't)
Oh, you don't have to say
(So, say it isn't)
Ooh, you know I wanna make you
(Say it isn't)
(Say it isn't)
So
