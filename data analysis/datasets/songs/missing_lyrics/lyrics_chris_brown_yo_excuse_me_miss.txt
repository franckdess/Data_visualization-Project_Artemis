Woah, woah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah

Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say, "Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step
Now if the music is moving too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's something about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by saying

Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Woah, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (Like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You want to do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!
