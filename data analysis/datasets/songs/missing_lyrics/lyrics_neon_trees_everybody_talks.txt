Hey baby won't you look my way
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby what you got to say
All you're giving me is fiction

I'm a sorry sucker
And this happens all the time
I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

Hey honey you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itching

Oh my, my shit
Everybody talks, everybody talks
Everybody talks too much

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

Never thought I'd live
To see the day
When everybody's words
Got in the way

Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you gotta say?

It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks
Everybody talks back

It started with a whisper
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
And that was when I kissed her
(Everybody talks, everybody talks)
Everybody talks
Everybody talks back
