Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' outta tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
But I gotta keep rollin'
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day
Well, the truck stop cutie comin' on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride, said I wouldn't be sorry
Oh, but she was just a baby
Well, waitress pour me another cup of coffee
Pop me down, jack me up, shoot me out flyin' down the highway
Lookin' for the morning
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day
Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' outta tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
I gotta keep rollin'
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day, yeah
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
