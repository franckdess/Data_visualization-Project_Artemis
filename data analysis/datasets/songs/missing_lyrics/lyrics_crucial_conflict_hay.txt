Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn

Sittin on a quarter P of hay, thangs is feelin good today
I'm tore up, from the floor up, sippin on some Crown Royal
Trippin, in a circle of wood where everybody smoke they own bud
Good ole' hay, how you feel today? Fine, blowed and dandy
Silly like I'm hype off candy, gotta big, thick chick named sandy
In the farm in the middle of the barn where everybody's feelin crazy
I went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave
We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin B's
Too blitzed to even shake it off, but I still got my head up
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut, blaze it up so I can hit that bud
Get me zoned and i'll be on cause I love to smoke upon hay


The hay got me goin through a stage and I just can't get enough
Smokin everyday, I got some hay and you know I'm finna roll it up
Make a cloud, I'm gonna take my mind away from all the bullcrap
Bump my sounds, lay back and roll, mack to the freaks that's on the road
Sometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets
Anybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be
In this session, manifesting on my P's and Q's, never snooze cause I refuse
Inhale, exhale the smell, smokin hay all by myself
Wildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side
If somethin jump off let it ride, on my square when time is live
Everybody throw it up, go to the barn and get some hay
When I get my choke on, fool you know I'm smokin on......

Hay now hay, we smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And I'm lit up, can't get up, my eyes are red and my head is spinnin
Took another pull, ridin red bull, got the goofies, can't stop grinnin
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids and we bout to get in em
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at and everything funny
Gotta pause some nigga tryna blow my high smokin all that hay with no money
Now truly this bitch wanna do me, so I hit the 151 Bacardi
She high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party
That hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps
And I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans
If you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean


Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word
Couldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride
Rollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin
Thank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'
