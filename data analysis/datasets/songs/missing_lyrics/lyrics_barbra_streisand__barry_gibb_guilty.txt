Shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet
Got a heartache of their own
It ought to be illegal
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It ought to be illegal
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on
You gotta be mine we take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far
We are and we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Pulse's racing, darling how grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
It ought to be illegal
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
It ought to be illegal
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on
You gotta be mine we take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far
We are and we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
I don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing, and we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far
We are and we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
Don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far
We are and we never let it end
