Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
'Cause I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
'Cause I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time

(Under the bridge downtown) Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown) I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown) Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown) I gave my life away
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Here I stay, yeah yeah
Here I stay
