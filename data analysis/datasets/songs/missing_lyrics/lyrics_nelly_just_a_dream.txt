I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream

I was at the top, and now it's like Iâ€™m in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear, now I can't take it
Knowin' somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I shoulda' put it down, shoulda' got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

My lover, my life
My shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I know that it just ain't right

I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream

When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryin' to get my Usher on, but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

And I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So, I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything
I said, if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything

I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So, I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream
I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So, I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream
