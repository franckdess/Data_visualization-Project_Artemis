Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (you remind me)

Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you, no no
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
