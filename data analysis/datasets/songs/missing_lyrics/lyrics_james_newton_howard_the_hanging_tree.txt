Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we’d both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of rope
Side by side with me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we’d both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
