Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I can hide what I'm feelin' inside
Another day, knowin' I love you
And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't want to see it end
If I tell you tonight will you turn out the light
And walk away knowing I love you?

I'm going to take you by surprise and make you realize
Amanda
I'm going to tell you right away, I can't wait another day
Amanda
I'm going to say it like a man and make you understand
Amanda
I love you
And I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me
To feel this way
I don't wanna lose you
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't want to lose you
I'm going to take you by surprise and make you realize
Amanda
I'm going to tell you right away, I can't wait another day
Amanda
I'm going to say it like a man and make you understand
Amanda
I love you
And I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me
To feel this way
I don't wanna lose you
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't want to lose you

You and I
I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I girl
We can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late

And, feeling the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you
