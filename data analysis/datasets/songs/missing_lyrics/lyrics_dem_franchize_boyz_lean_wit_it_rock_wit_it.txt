Lean wit it, rock wit it!

I bounce in the club so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and I'm looking for a blockhead
Yup in my white tee
I break a bitch back
And I keep a big bank
Oh I think they like that
Before I leave the house I'm slizzard on the goose
And I'm higher than a plane so a nigga really loose
And I can lean wit it (lean wit it)
And I can rock wit it (rock wit it)
And if you gotta friend
She gotta suck a cock wit it!

Ay gon and rock wit it (gon rock wit it)
Gon and lean wit it (gon lean wit it)
Rock so damn hard, you break your spleen wit it (you break your spleen wit it)
Pull up ya jeans wit it (pull up ya jeans wit it)
Smoke some green wit it (smoke some green wit it)
And the spot ain't crunk bitch if we ain't in it
If you don't wanna do it, then I'll make you dance
Perfect example watch me make your face beat up my hands
When you see me hit the spot, betta watch that boy
Charlay, from the road wit Dem Franchize Boyz

Lean wit it, rock wit it!

I'm too clean to wanna pop lock
From left to right a nigga lean
Vibing to the beat, check my feet
You ain't got these
I rock then bend my knees
Everytime the beat drop
Lean wit it Rock wit me
Freeze befo' your fingers pop
Purple leen purple green grams in my sock
What the fuck you mean
You ain't seen buddy on the block
They call me Doctor Doc
I prescribe what a nigga need
Make 'em lean and rock
Old school people pat cha feet

Shit I'm pimpin in the club
Til the hoes start to act up
Cuz they see my chain
And a nigga throwing them stacks up
I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo'
They screaming 'Nigga do your dance'!
You can roll yo arms (roll yo arms)
And just put 'em in rotation (rotation)
Go side to side
And snap yo fingers like temptations
Dog I'm all out of state
Doin a dance they never seen that
I ain't Fat Joe
But snap your fingers then you lean back

Lean wit it, rock wit it!

Rock left then snap your fingers, rock right then snap your fingers
Ay what's happenin', lean wit me, rock wit me
Gotta pill pop wit me, go on take a shot wit me
Call me Teddy, I got grams don't hate, nigga shop wit me
D.F.B So So Def, hell yeah we known bitch
Franchize ain't got no money? Shit hold on hold on bitch
Rock left Rock right, You can get that (Shit)
Lean back like Fat Joe and snap your wrist back

Gangsters don't dance (Naw) They lean wit it rock wit it
Glock wit me Pop quickly
Gangsters gon rock wit it
1,2 pop and bring it cross the chest wit it
Get nasty flashy Go on flex wit it
Do it how you wanna
Slow it up do the Matrix
Play wit it straight hit it
Get all in their face wit it
This dance for the killers, the dealers, the cut throats
You already know
The chillen, the grown folk

Lean wit it, rock wit it!
