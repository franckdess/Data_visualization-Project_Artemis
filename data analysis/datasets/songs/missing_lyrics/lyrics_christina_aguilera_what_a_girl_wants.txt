What a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
(Yeah, come on)

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together, oh, while I figured it out
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holding hands, making plans
And it's lucky for me you understand

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me

What I want is what you got
And what you got, is what I want

It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more than

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Somebody sensitive, courageous
Sexy, cool, like you
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants (you're so right)
What a girl needs (you're so right)
You let a girl know how much you care about her
I swear you're the one who always knew
You knew, you knew, you knew, you knew
Ooh, I'm thanking you for being there for me

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
Whatever keeps me in your arms, that's what I need
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Oh, baby, oh darlin', I thank you
Thank you for givin' me what I need
And for what I want
