I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea
Who can I believe in
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force, who do I phone

The stars are out and shining
But all I really wanna know

Oh, won't you show me the way (everyday)
I want you show me the way, yeah


Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play-ay my part

Well, someone thought of healing
But all I really wanna know

Oh, won't you show me the way (everyday)
I want you, show me the way, oh
I want you day after day, yeah


Yeah, I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me

I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love

Oh, won't you show me the way (everday)
Oh, won't you show me the way (one more time)
I want you day after day, hey
I want you day after day, hey

I want you to show me the way (everyday)
I want you to show me the way (night and day)
I want you day after day, hey, oh
