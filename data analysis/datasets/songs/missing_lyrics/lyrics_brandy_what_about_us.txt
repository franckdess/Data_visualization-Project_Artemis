Woo!
Yeah, Darkchild
B-Rocka
Let's go

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy (what?)
What the hell? I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right

I don't need this bull -ish
I won't put up with it any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity
I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what

What about all of the things that you say?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you say?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about, what about us?
What about us? (What about?)
What about us? (Uh, what about?)
What about us? (What about us, uh?)

Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need (what?)
What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
Cause you're counterfeit, I see

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity
I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what

What about all of the things that you say?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you say?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about, what about us?
What about us? (What about it?)
What about us? (What about it?)
What about us? (What about us?)

Baby, check it out, hear this
Now, what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with?
Now, what if I told you the game we played, I picked it?
Now, what if I said it wasn't true, so do you?
You and I know, without me there's no you
Now what about bills that were passed due, paid for you?
And all you said to me is, "Baby, I owe you"
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
Don't "what about us" to me, cause we are through
(Don't "what about us" to me)

What about all of the things that you say? (What about em?)
What about all of the promises that you made? (Woo!)
What about all of the nights that you gave? (Uh huh)
What about all of the things you told me? (Yeah)
What about all of the things that you say? (Uh huh)
What about all of the promises that you made? (Uh huh)
What about all of the nights that you gave? (C'mon)
What about, what about, what about us? (B-Rocka)
What about all of the things that you said? (Let's go)
What about all of the promises that you made? (C'mon)
What about all of the nights that you gave? (Yeah)
What about all of the things you told me? (Yeah)
What about all of the things that you said? (Uh huh)
What about all of the promises that you made?(C'mon)
What about all of the nights that you gave? (Uh huh)
What about, what about, what about us?(C'mon)
What about us? (B-Rocka)
What about us? (B-Rocka)
What about us? (B-B-B-Rocka)
What about us? (It's B-Rocka, y'all, F.J.)

Uh huh (uh-uh, Ray J)
Uh huh (uh-uh, Big Bert)
Uh huh (uh-uh, Alex)
Uh huh (uh-uh, J Mac)
Uh huh (uh-uh, )
Uh huh (uh-uh, )
Uh huh (uh-uh-uh, B-Rocka... Darkchild)
