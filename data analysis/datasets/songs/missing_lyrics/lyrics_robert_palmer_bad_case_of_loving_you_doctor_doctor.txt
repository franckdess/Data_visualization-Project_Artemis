Whoa
A hot summer night fell like a net
I've gotta find my baby yet
I need you to soothe my head
Turn my blue heart to red
Doctor, doctor, gimme the news
I got a bad case of loving you
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I've got a bad case of lovin' you
A pretty face don't make no pretty heart
I learned that, buddy, from the start
You think I'm cute, a little bit shy
Mama, I ain't that kind of guy
Doctor, doctor, gimme the news
I got a bad case of loving you
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I got a bad case of lovin' you
Whoa
I know you like it, you like it on top
Tell me, mama, are you gonna stop?
You had me down twenty-one to zip
Smile of Judas on your lip
Shake my fist, knock on wood
I've got it bad and I got it good
Doctor, doctor, gimme the news
I've got a bad case of loving you
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I got a bad case of lovin' you
