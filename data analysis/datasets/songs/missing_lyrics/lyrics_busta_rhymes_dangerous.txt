Hey, another one of them Flipmode joints
Busta Rhymes y'all, word mother y'all, check it out y'all
Just swing to the left, swing to the right
Make ya feel good, feel alright
One time, feel good yeah y'all
Busta Rhymes in the place y'all
Makin you feel real good y'all
Flipmode is the Squad in the place y'all

Buckwild to all of my niggas who don’t care
Floss like a bunch of young black millionaires
Makin ya run, me and my Dunn, stackin my ones
Floss a lil', invest up in a mutual fund
Blowin the horn, a sense of every day I was born
Never dream I see a nigga landscaping my lawn
Dangerous, my nigga shit be accurate
Have to get, the flow be so immaculate
Ayo, ayo, watchin my dough, sippin my Moe'
Slippin in slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello
Anyway go ‘head and diss, play your Oil of Olay
Little honeydip within a little Cariola
I don’t mean to hold you up but I got somethin to say
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us, you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us, that’s when we gettin dangerous, come on

This, is, serious
We could make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
'Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

Hold your breath, we swingin it from right to left
Word to Wyclef, nigga shit be hot to death
Stayin Alive, you know only the stronger survive
Holdin my heat, under my seat, whippin my five
Bassline for all of my people movin around
Give me a pound, all of my niggas holdin it down
Cuttin you up, the new shit, ruckin you up
Fuckin you up, my black hole, suckin you up
Back in the days, a nigga used to be ass out
Now a nigga holdin several money market accounts
Blaze the street, and then I would just like to announce
Feelin my groove, my jigga jigga makin you bounce
Others is fair, me and my niggas breakin the bread
Straight gettin it, we got you niggas holdin your head
Afraid of us, you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us, that’s when we gettin dangerous, come on

This, is, serious
We could make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
'Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

Throw your hands real high y'all
Yea, get down y'all
Let me see you all y'all
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode y'all
Nineteen ninety eight y'all
Ha, get down ya’ll
Let’s have a ball y'all

Feelin the heat up in the street rockin the beat
Step up in the club, take me to my reserved seat
Comin around, all of my niggas surround me
So much bottles of liquor, y'all niggas’ll drown me
Makin ya drunk, feelin the funk, blazin the skunk
Stay hittin with the shit that blow a hole in ya trunk
Afraid of us, you know this ain’t no game to us
You strange to us that’s when we gettin dangerous, come on

This, is, serious
We could make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
'Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My Flipmode Squad is dangerous
So dangerous, we so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous
