I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush, that I just did not want
Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

But I am not every girl and I do not need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty has got a job, shorty has got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Do not want to dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who has got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It is what every fly girl could want or even dream

But I am not every girl and I do not need any G to take care of me
Because shorty has got a job, shorty has got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Do not want to dance if it is not in my heart, no no

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

But I am not every girl
And I do not need no G to take care of me, no
Because Shorty has got a job, Shorty has got a car, Shorty can pay her own rent
Do not want to dance if it is not in my heart
(Oh most girls)

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Because I am not most girls, do not want to dance if he cannot be everything
I, I just want real love, said I got to have real love
Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of
