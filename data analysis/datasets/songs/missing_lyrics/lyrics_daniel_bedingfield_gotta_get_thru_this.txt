If only I can get through this
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you

Give me just a second then I'll be alright
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight

When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you?
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I can get through this
If only I can get through this
If only I can get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you

Give me just a second then I'll be alright
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight

When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you?
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I can get through this
If only I can get through this
If only I can get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this
I just gotta get through this
Whoa, whoa
If only I can get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this
Whoa, whoa
If only I can get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this
Whoa, whoa
If only I can get through this
I just gotta get through this
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this
