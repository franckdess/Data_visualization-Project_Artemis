You know where I can be found
Don't you know I'll be waiting
By the telephone, girl
While you're out
Running around, yeah
I'm sitting home all alone
I'm a fool, just a silly fool
To be in love with you
You can't be kind to me, girl
You always treat me bad, girl
But I can't let you go, I know
It would only make me sad
I'm a fool, just a silly fool
To be in love with you
You treat me just like dirt
You have all the fun
I stay at home and hurt
Baby, I wish I knew, yeah
Just how to get you
Off my mind, girl
To put you down and
Say we're through, yeah
I think about you all the time
I'm a fool, just a silly fool
To be in love with you
Baby, I wish I knew, yeah
Just how to get you
Off my mind, girl
To put you down and
Say we're through, yeah
I think about you all the time
I'm a fool, just a silly fool
To be in love with you
I'm a fool, I'm a fool
I'm a fool, I'm a fool
