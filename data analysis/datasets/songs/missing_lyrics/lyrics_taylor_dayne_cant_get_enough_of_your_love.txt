I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
But I don't know about that, as many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love, it doesn't seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough, it's just not enough, oh no
My darlin', I can't get enough of your love, baby
No, I don't know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love, baby
Oh, some things I can't get used to, no matter how I try, oh
It seems the more you give the more I want
And baby, that's no lie, oh no
Tell me what can I say, what am I gonna do?
How should I feel, when everything is you, you, you
What kind of a love is this that you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet, sweet
You're all I know and every time you're near
I feel a change, something's movin'
I scream your name, what you got me doin'
Darlin', I, oh, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Oh, I don't know, don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, baby, oh
If I could only make you see and make you understand
Boy, your love for me is all I need now
And more than I can stand, oh well
How can I explain all the things I feel, you've given me so much
Boy, you're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Well, I keep loving you more and more each time
Boy, what am I gonna do 'cause you've blown my mind, oh
I get the same old feelin', every time you're near
I feel a change, something's movin'
I scream your name, what you got me doin'
Darlin', I, oh, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Oh, baby, didn't take all of my life to find you
And sure ain't gonna take the rest of my life
To keep you, yeah, keep you happy
No darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', yeah happy, ooh
My darlin', I, oh, I can't get enough of your love, baby
Ooh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why, why
Can't get enough of your love, baby, oh
Oh, my darlin', my darlin', my darlin'
I can't get enough of your love, baby
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, your love, your love, ooh
Can't get enough
Can't get enough
Can't get enough
