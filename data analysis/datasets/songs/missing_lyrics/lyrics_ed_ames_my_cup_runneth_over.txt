Sometimes in the morning
When shadows are deep
I lie here beside you
Just watching you sleep
And sometimes I whisper
What I'm thinking of
My cup runneth over
With love
Sometimes in the evening
When you do not see
I study the small things
You do constantly
I memorize moments
That I'm fondest of
My cup runneth over
With love
In only a moment
We both will be old
We won't even notice
The world turning cold
And so, in these moments
With sunlight above
My cup runneth over
With love
My cup runneth over
With love
With love
