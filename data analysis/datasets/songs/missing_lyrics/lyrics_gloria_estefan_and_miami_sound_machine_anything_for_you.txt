Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong
I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care
And I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying
And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that
I don't love you
That for one minute
I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to
And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy
I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care
And I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying
Don't you ever think that
I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
