I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'ma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
'Cause hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and I'm a flirt

Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me, ya dig?...
Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well known to flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
'Cause you leave ya wife and I see ya wife now be for real
How long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife?
Well I'm living the life, you just getting it right
Ya old lady look at me 'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you cause you the business type
But that's 'til I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
That's when I noticed she was checking me and digging the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang
Sit that right up on that dresser, yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair like we getting in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G 'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt, the McLaren in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

When I, when I, when I...
When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, "Damn twenty-eights"
Then I be like "girl you know just who I am, don't hate"
See I done Fell in Love with a Stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pat
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'ma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass-Down
I be like "Como se llama, lil' mama? Me llamo Pain
What is your name? I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same"
I'ma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
"He's so fly, yes he's so cool"
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad 'cause I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad 'cause I'm a flirt

Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt

Oh, it's, the, re-mix...
Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she looking at me then I'm gon' hit
Man jacking for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club, acting like you in love
Stunting like you all thug, we was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by
You turn your head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling me daddy, I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means? That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the V.I.P cause I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga, it's a playa's field my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
'Cause I'ma flirt with her, right, he gon' flirt with her, right
And if she lickin' that good shit, she gon' flirt with her
