Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave chicane
Staring as she called my name

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here till night
Searching for her silver light

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no no


Bank job in the city
Robin Hood and William Tell and Ivanhoe and Lancelot, they don't envy me
Sitting till the sun goes down
In dreams the world keep going round and round

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no no
And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no no
No, I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no no no no
