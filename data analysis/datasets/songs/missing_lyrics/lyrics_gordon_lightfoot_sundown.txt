I can see her lyin' back
In her satin dress
In a room where you do
What you don't confess
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
She's been lookin' like a queen
In a sailor's dream
And she don't always say
What she really means
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
I can picture every move
That a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin'
Is your first mistake
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again
I can see her lookin' fast
In her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman
Got me feelin' mean
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again
