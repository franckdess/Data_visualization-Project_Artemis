I have a pocketfull of quarters
And I'm headed to the arcade
I don't have alot of money
But I'm bringing everything I made
I have a calis on my finger
And my shoulder's hurtin', too
I'm gonna eat 'em all up
Just as soon as they turn blue
'Cause I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)

I've got all the patterns down
Up to the ninth key
I've got Speedy on my tail
And I know it's either him or me
So I'm heading out the back
Going in and out the side
Gonna eat all the cherries up
And take 'em all for a ride
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)

I'm gonna faint to the left
Then move to the right
'Cause Pokey's too slow
And Blinky's outta sight

Now I've got them on the run
And I'm lookin' for the high score
So it's once around the block
Then I stop back out the side door
Uhh!!
I'm really cookin' now
Eatin' everything in sight
All my money is gone
So I'll be back tommorrow night
'Cause I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
Drivin' me
Drivin' me
Drivin' me crazy
Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)
Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
It's drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
I got Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
I'm goin' outta my mind (Goin' outta my mind)
P-P-P-P-Pac Man Fever (Pac Man Fever)
