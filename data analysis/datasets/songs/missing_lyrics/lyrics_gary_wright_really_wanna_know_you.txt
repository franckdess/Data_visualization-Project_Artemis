What I do mind if not being loved
Maybe you're feeling the same way too
You're ready to hold someone
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
Something about you is telling me
We're coming from the very same place
It's only just a notion I have
I see it written over your face
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you

Something I've been searching my whole life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
Tell me what you're gonna do
I wanna know yeah, yeah, yeah
Every time I see you
It's the same thing all over again
You're doing something to me it's true

Something I've been searching my whole life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
