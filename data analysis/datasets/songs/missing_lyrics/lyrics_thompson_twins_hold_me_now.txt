I have a picture
Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and
We're laughing, we're loving it all
But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight
And delight in the tears
That we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start

You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching
For some perfect world
We know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, and go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be
Than with you here today
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa
Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa

You ask if I love you
Well, what can I say?
You know that I do
And that this is just one
Of those games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry anymore
I'll even ask your forgiveness
Though I don't know
Just what I'm asking it for
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, (hold me in your loving arms) whoa
Warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa
Hold me now, (hold me in your loving arms) whoa
Warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa
Hold me now, (hold me in your loving arms) whoa
Warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa
Hold me now, (hold me in your loving arms) whoa
Warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa
Hold me now, (hold me in your loving arms) whoa
Warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start, whoa
