Sure I've been in love a time or two
But in the end I still chose you
No one could ever make me feel this way
That's why it's killing me, what we're going through
Somehow thought 'tween me and you
Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade

But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same?
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby)

Girl, I know that things aren't going right
But don't you think it deserves a fight?
A love like ours don't happen every day
And we're losing it (Losing it) right as we speak
And if we don't wake up, it's a memory
A time gone past, a love that sailed away

And we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
(We're not even trying to change)
Tell me how it slips away
(Tell me how it slips away)
Does it ever stay the same?
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
(We're running out of words to say)
Tell me it don't have to change
(No, it don't have to change)
Won't it ever stay the same?

I dream of lovers past and
I see a girl so sad 'cause
She lost the only man she loved
He went away
Well, it's not too late for us
To change

But we're not making love no more
(We're not making love no)
We're not even trying to change
(Not even trying to change)
Tell me how it slips away
(Been trying to change, baby)
Does it ever stay the same?
We don't even talk no more
(We don't even talk no more)
We've ran out of words to say
(We used to be best friends)
Tell me it don't have to change
(Don't even have to change, have to change)
Won't it ever stay the same?
(Dru Hill, let me sing it)

(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Hey hey
(Does it ever stay the same?)
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Sometimes, I get a little lonely
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) 'Cause I remember
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) You used to say to me, Sisqo
(Won't it ever stay the same?) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(We're not making love no more) I'm gonna be here for you
(We're not even trying to change) I would wipe your tears for you
(Tell me how it slips away) How did it slip away?
(Does it ever stay the same?) Hey hey hey hey hey
(We don't even talk no more) We don't even talk no more, no
(We ran out of words to say) We ran out of words to say
