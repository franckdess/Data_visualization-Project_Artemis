I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind (mind)
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like "What's up man, what's happenin'?" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all and see the show tonight (ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9, haha

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (they be snappin' baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

We'll take a journey into my mind (mind), you'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (ah)
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
