Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said "There’s another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like...

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone, I'm gone
