I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of

Moonlight, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby

Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I want to be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
All I want is

Moonlights, with you there inside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise, oh boy
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal, you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh darling you and me
Light my fire
Blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away

Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise, oh boy
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby
