When I think of all the worries
That people seem to find
And how they're in a hurry
To complicate their minds
By chasing after money
And dreams that can't come true
I'm glad that we are different
We've better things to do
May others plan their future
I'm busy loving you
One, two, three, four
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today (Hey, hey, hey)
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
Live for today
We were never meant to worry
The way that people do
And I don't need to hurry
As long as I'm with you
We'll take it nice and easy
And use my simple plan
You'll be my lovin' woman
I'll be your lovin' man
We'll take the most from living
Have pleasure while we can
Two, three, four
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today (Hey, hey, hey)
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
Live for today
Baby, I need to feel you inside of me
I got to feel you deep inside of me
Baby, please come close to me
I got to have you now, please
Please, please, please
Gimme some-a loving
Gimme some-a loving
To gimme some-a loving
To gimme some-a loving
Baby, gimme some-a loving
Gimme some-a loving
Got to have all your loving
Gimme some-a loving
I need all your loving
Give me some love
Now I need all your loving
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today (Hey, hey, hey)
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
Sha-la, la-la-la-la, live for today
