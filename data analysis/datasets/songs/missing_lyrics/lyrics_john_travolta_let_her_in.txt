I'm different today, hey-hey
Somethin' she said has stuck in my head
And I can't get away
Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life
You know what I find, I find
A look at her face and there isn't a trace
Of doubt in my mind
Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my life
Gonna open up
After so long
Gonna open up
After so long
With my feet stuck on the ground
And my head against the wall
I've been called
And I can't answer why, why-hy
Somethin' inside and it can't be denied
And I'm ready to try
Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life
Gonna let her in
Gonna let her in, um-hmm
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my life
Gonna let her in, woah-woah
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my li-fe
Gonna let her in, woah-woah
Gonna let her in my life
Let her in my li-fe
