Hey lady
Let me tell you why I
I can't live my life without you
(Ooooh baby)
Everytime I see you walkin by I cannot think
You don't notice me, but in time you will
I must make you understand

(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do, yeah yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man

Better not pass me by
'Cause if you do you'll lose good thing (thing)
(Oooh baby)
'Cause what I gotta say
Is sealed with a kiss
And a wedding ring (wedding ring)
My mind is blind at times
I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter
No, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand

(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do yeah yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man

Words can never say what I feel
It's too intense
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh)
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
To tell you how I feel
But I get mixed up (so mixed up)
My mind is blind at times
I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter
No, they can't spoil my view (view)
I must make you understand

(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do yeah yeah
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man
(I wanna be your man)
Yes I do
(I wanna be your man)
(I wanna be your man)
Wanna be your man
