Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need

And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me

Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher

I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal

Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need to get by
