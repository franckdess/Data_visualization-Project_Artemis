I've never been so sure about anything before
But this loving feeling
Gonna be a feeling I feel forever more
Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
As long as there's forever, baby
I will always be

Saving forever for you
Ooh, baby
You are the only one
I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do
Baby
Wanna always stay together
So I'm saving forever
For you

You'll be my world as long as
There's a world turning around
And you'll be my heaven, baby
Till the heavens all come falling down
Look inside my heart
Love is all you'll see
I'll loving you forever, baby
Leave it just to me


Forever
I'll be loving you
Long as time passes by
I'll there beside you
All through it all
I'll be standing by you
Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be
Needing you here with me
