Do we deserve a second chance?
How did we fall into this circumstance?
We weren't so straight and narrow
This is much more than we deserve
A higher voice has called the tune
Two hearts that lost the beat will now resume
The gift of life extension
By divine intervention

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Telling me to get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we've found
The second time around

Don't understand what's going on
Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone
This is a new beginning
I'm back in the land of the living

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
And I gotta get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found
The second time around

Oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Oh I'm gonna get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found
The second time around
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Oh I'm gonna get it right this time
Life (life) doesn't mean a thing
(Doesn't mean a thing)
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found
(What we found)
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that heaven can wait
Life (life) doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we found...
