Yeah!
For the 1st time it's going down, history baby
New Three 6 Mafia, featuring Eightball and MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing

I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives and  keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns, a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple & swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

Puff, puff pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

What's up Mary, how you doing
Mary Jane, stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the 'gar

I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

Premro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lot of weed, but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J
8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

Fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
