I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me feeling like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feeling as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
'Cause I can't get you out my mind

Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower

Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
Singing in the shower
Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
Singing in the shower

All I want, all I need is your loving
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Since you came you know what I've discovered
Baby I don't need me another
No, no all I know (know)
Only you got me feeling so (so)
And you know that I got to have ya
And I don't plan to let you go

Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower

Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
Singing in the shower
Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
Yeah, singing in the shower

There ain't no guarantee
But I'll take a chance on we
Baby let's take our time
(Singing in the shower)
And when the times get rough
There ain't no giving up
'Cause it just feels so right
(Singing in the shower)

Don't care what others say
If I got you I'm straight
You bring my heart to life yeah

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower

Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa 
Singing in the shower
Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
You got me singing in the shower
Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
Singing in the shower
Ladadee ladadaa ladadaa
