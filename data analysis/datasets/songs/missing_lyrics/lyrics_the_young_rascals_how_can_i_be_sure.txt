How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure
Where I stand with you?
Whenever I
Whenever I am away from you
I wanna die
'Cause you know I wanna stay with you
How do I know?
Maybe you're trying to use me
Flying too high can confuse me
Touch me but don't take me down
Whenever I
Whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people
I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hanging around
With my head up upside down
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone
Who's as pretty and lovely as you
How can I be sure?
I really really really wanna know
I really really really wanna know, oh
How's the weather?
Weather or not, we're together
Together we'll see it much better
I love you, I love you forever
You know where I can be found
How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?
I'll be sure with you
