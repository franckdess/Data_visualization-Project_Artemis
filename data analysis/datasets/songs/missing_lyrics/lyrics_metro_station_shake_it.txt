The Shot
Yeah, Come on

I'll take you home, if you don't leave me at the front door (Leave me at the front door)
Your body's cold, but girl we're getting so warm
And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside (Get inside)

Tonight you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that? C'mon
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake that
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake that
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

Your lips tremble, but your eyes are in a straight stare (Eyes are in a straight stare)
We're on the bed, but your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places that I could hide (I could hide)

Tonight you're falling in love (Let me go now)
This feeling's tearing me up (Here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that? C'mon
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake that
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake that
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

I saw you dancing and I couldn't get you off my mind
(And I could tell that you could tell that I was taking my time)
But I was thinking of ways to get you staying the night
(Your body's shaking, tell me off so I can turn off the lights)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that? C'mon
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake that
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake that
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it

Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
Shake shake, shake shake, a-shake it
