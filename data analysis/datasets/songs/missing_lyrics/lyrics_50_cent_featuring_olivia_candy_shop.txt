Yeah, uh-huh
So seductive

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa

You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh-huh)

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa

Girl, what we do, what we do
And where we do, and where we do
The things we do, things we do
Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip ‘til every bubble in every bottle is gone

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
