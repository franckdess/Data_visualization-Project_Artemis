He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool, no

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off and runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you when he's out?

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool, no

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love, girl, with him there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool, no

You could find somebody better girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better girl
He's c-cold as ice
He's cold as ice
He's cold as ice
Stay away from him, girl

C-c-c-cold-hearted, ooh-ah-ah
C-c-c-cold-hearted, snnnnnake
C-c-c-cold-hearted, ooh-ah-ah
C-c-c-cold-hearted, snnnnnake

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool
Ooh, ahh, look into his eyes
Ooh, ahh, he's been tellin' lies
Ooh, ahh, he don't play by rules
Ooh, ahh, girl, don't play the fool
He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by the rules, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool
He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes, uh-oh
He's been tellin' lies
