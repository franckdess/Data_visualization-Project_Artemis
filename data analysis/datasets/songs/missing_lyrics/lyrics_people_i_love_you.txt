I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
But the words won't come & I don't know what to say
I should tell you, I love you, I do
My words should explain, but my words won't come
I shouldn't hide my love deep inside
My words should explain, but my words won't come
I should tell you just how I feel, & I keep tryin'
But something holds me back when I try to tell you
CHORUS:
I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I do
But the words won't come & I don't know what to say
If I can find the words in my mind
The words could explain, but the words won't come
If you can see what you mean to me
My words should explain, but my words won't come
& oh how hard I try to tell you I love you
But something holds me back when I try to tell you
(chorus)
(instrumental)
& I don't know what to say
& oh how hard I try to tell you I love you
But something holds me back when I try to tell you
(chorus x2; 2nd time, minus last line)
