Look out behind you
Jojo's got his gun
He wouldn't mean to do but
Ya know he likes his fun
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
Jojo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines, you know him
You know him
He's got you covered
You'll know it right our front
Hey fifty dollars
He'll get you all you want
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
Jojo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines, you know him
Ever so rarely that man in a millon's born
Gentle and soft, but who'd just as soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
Jojo, go Jo
His baby stays high
Got to keep her sweet
He keep her just right
Keeps her on the street
Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
(Way out games and dizzy heights)
Oh below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights
Oh you know him
(Jo you are so low
Oh Oh Jo how low can you go)
Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
(Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights)
Broadway nights
You know him
Say what do you think
Of gentlemen wearing mink
Gentle and soft
But who'd just as soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
(Jo Jo) Jo Jo
So look out behind you
Jojo got a gun
Though he wouldn't mean to
He likes his fun
Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
Man its way below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights
Flashing lights below him
Yeah yeah
Jo Jo
How low can you go
Jo Jo Oh Oh
