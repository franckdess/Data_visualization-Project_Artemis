Set me free, why don't cha babe?
Get out my life, why don't cha babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep a comin' around
Playin' with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Lettin' me get over you
The way you've gotten over me
Set me free, why don't cha babe?
Let me be, why don't cha babe?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Now, you don't really want me
You just keep me hangin' on
You say, although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seein' you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothin' I can do about it
Woo, set me free, why don't cha babe?
Woo, get out my life, why don't cha babe?
Set me free, why don't cha babe?
Get out my life, why don't cha babe?
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold onto me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else, hey
Why don't you be a man about it and set me free?
Now you don't care a thing about me, you're just usin' me
Go on, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
