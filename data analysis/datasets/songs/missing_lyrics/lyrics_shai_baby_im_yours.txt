Understand, girl
That my heart is in your hands
And I'm cautious of falling in love again
So please don't hurt me
I'm scared
Don't desert me
I'm afraid of being a fool
Again

So baby, I'm yours
If you want me (and if you want my sweet love)
And baby, I'm yours
If you need me (la la la)
And loving you forever
If you want me (give me your love)
Baby, I'm yours
If you need me

Realize, girl
That my faith is kind of torn
Watch your step, girl, because my heart is weak and worn
So won't you please be careful
I'm fragile
I can't imagine the damage
I have to handle
If you hurt me one more time, please be mine

So baby, I'm yours
If you want me (and if you want my sweet love)
And baby, I'm yours
If you need me (la la la)
And loving you forever
If you want me (give me your love)
Baby, I'm yours
If you need me

Baby, I've been through a whole lot of relationships
Whole lot of broken promises
But now I'm ready for a real one, sweetheart
(Yes, I am)
You don't have to worry, baby
Don't you ever go away

Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours

So baby, I'm yours
If you want me
And baby, I'm yours
If you need me
And loving you forever
If you want me
Baby, I'm yours
If you need me (I'm right here, baby)
So baby, I'm yours (I'll be right here)
If you want me (I'm the one that you need)
And baby, I'm yours (I'll be the one, you and me, baby)
If you need me
And loving you forever (I'll be right here)
If you want me (For you, girl)
Baby, I'm yours
If you need me
So baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
If you want me (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
And baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
If you need me (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
And loving you forever (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
If you want me (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
If you need me (Baby, I'm... baby, baby, I'm yours)
