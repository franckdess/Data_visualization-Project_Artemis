A thumb goes up, a car goes by
It's nearly 1 AM and here am I
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home by the mornin' light
I've got no fare to ride a train
I'm nearly drownin' in the pourin' rain
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home to my baby's side
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Long-distance call I got today
She sounded lonely, so I'm on my way
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home to keep her satisfied
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
A thumb goes up, a car goes by
Won't somebody stop to help a guy
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
I've been away too long from my baby's side
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
