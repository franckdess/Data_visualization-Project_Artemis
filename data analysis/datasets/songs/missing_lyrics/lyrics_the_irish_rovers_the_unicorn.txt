A long time ago when the earth was green
And there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen
They'd run around free while the earth was being born
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn
There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn
Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain
And He says "Stand back, I'm going to make it rain."
He says "Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...
Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
Don't you forget My Unicorn."
Old Noah was there to answer the call
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through, "Hey Lord, I got your..."
Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord I'm so forlorn
I just can't see no Unicorn."
Then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring
Oh them silly Unicorns
There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Noah cried "Close the door, cause the rain is pouring
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn."
The ark started movin, it drifted with the tide
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day
You'll see green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
You're never gonna see no Unicorn
