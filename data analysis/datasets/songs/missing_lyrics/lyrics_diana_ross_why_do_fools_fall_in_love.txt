Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of the day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Love is a losing game
And love can be a shame
I know of a fool, you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of the day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
For I know
It will reach defeat
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Why do fools fall in love?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
