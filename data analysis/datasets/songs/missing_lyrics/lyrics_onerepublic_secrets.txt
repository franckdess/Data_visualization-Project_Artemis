I need another story 
Something to get off my chest 
My life gets kind of boring 
Need something that I can confess

'Til all my sleeves are stained red 
From all the truth that I've said 
Come by it honestly I swear 
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far 
It's like we're chasing all those stars 
Who drive the shiny big black cars

And everyday I see the news 
All the problems that we could solve 
And when a situation rises 
Just write it into an album
Seen it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no, so

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Got no reason 
Got no shame 
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear 
I'mma tell you everything

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Tell me what you want to hear 
Something that will light those ears 
I'm sick of all the insincere 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time 
Don't need another perfect lie 
Don't care if critics ever jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

All my secrets away

All my secrets away
