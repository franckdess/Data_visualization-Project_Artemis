I got a little change in my pocket going jing-a-ling-a-ling
Wanna call you on the telephone, baby, I give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy
I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said
"No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"


You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love
Started talking about sin
I said
"Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said
No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
"Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
