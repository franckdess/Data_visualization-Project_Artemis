Uno, dos
One, two, tres, quatro
Matty told Hatty about a thing she saw
Had two big horns and a wooly jaw
Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully
Hatty told Matty: "Let's don't take no chance
Let's not be *L-seven*, come and learn to dance."
Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully
Matty told Hatty: "That's the thing to do
Get you someone really to pull the wool with you."
Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully
