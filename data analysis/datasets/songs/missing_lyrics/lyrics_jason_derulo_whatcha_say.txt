But me and you were meant to last forever (forever)
So let me in (let me in), give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man

Knowing that I let our love go? (Love go)
And ooh (ooh), what I'd do (do) with one chance (chance)

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you we're meant to be together
So let me in (let me in), give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man
