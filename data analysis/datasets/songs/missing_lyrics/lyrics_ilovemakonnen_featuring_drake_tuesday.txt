Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Squad goin' up
Nobody flippin' packs now
I just did three in a row
Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up

Goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

It ain't no way, no how
I made it on my own
I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta go
Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Got the club goin' up
