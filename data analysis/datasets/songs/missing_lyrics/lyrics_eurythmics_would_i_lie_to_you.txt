Would I lie to you? (oh yeah)
Would I lie to you honey? (oh, no, no no)
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar, would I lie to you?
My friends know what's in store
I won't be here anymore
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor
Watch me walking
Walking out the door
(Believe me) I'll make it, make it
(Believe me) I'll make it, make it
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey? (oh honey, would I lie to you?)
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar, would I lie to you?
Tell you straight, no intervention
To your face, no deception
You're the biggest fake
That much is true
Had all I can take
Now I'm leaving you
(Believe me) I'll make it, make it (oh yes, I will)
(Believe me) I'll make it, make it (make it, make it)
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar, would I lie?
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?
My friends know what's in store
I won't be here anymore
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor
Watch me walking
Walking out the door
(Believe me) Watch me, watch me
(Believe me) Watch me, watch me, yes I will, yeah
Would I lie to you?
