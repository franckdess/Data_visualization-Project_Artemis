What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh
Say I'm gonna leave
A hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away
(Just can't break away)
Oh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Ooh, young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you
It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm
I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self preservation is what's really going on today
Say I'm gonna turn loose
A thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When I just can't break away
(When I just can't break away)
Oh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
You and me
Ooh, young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you
Young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh, young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
It don't love you
Ooh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh, young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you
Ooh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
