You take my breath away
Love thinks it's here to stay
There's still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true
If you could see what I have seen
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Then I wake up and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care
Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take
You, you take my breath away
Love thinks it's here to stay
Still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true
Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take
Then I wake up and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care
Don't forget me when I'm gone
For heaven's sake
I have loved you for so long
Is loving wrong
So don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
Is loving wrong
