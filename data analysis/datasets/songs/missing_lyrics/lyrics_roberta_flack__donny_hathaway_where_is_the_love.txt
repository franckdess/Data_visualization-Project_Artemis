Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Where is the love
You said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free
Will it ever be?
Where is the love?

You told me that you didn't love him
And you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

Where is the love?
You said was mine all mine, 'til the end of time
Was it just a lie?
Where is the love?

If you had, had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so
Don't leave me hangin' on the promises
You've got to let me know


Oh, how I wish I never met you
I guess it must have been my fate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait
That's all I can do
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Where is the love?
