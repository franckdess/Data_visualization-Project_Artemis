I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end
Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring
I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me
It's not just a physical rush
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough
Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart
Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other
If the moment is right
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
I've tread those mean streets
Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch, no feeling
Just another one night stand
I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayers
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this the love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love
