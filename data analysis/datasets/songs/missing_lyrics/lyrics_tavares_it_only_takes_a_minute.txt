Yeah yeah
Once an hour of the day
We threw at least fun away
Walk the streets half a year
Tryin' to find a new career
Now if you get a flu attack
For 30 days you're on your back
Through the night I've seen you dance
Baby, give me half a chance
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, let's fall in love
Now in the unemployment lines
You can spend your life readin' signs
Waitin' for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you
(Yeah)
Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
(Haven't accomplished a thing)
So baby, leave a little time
'Cause you never know what's on my mind, yeah
It only takes a minute girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl, yeah
To fall in love, let's fall in love
Will you find yourself a few minutes
(Fall in love)
Will you wanna fry yourself an egg
(Fall in love)
Now you spare a few second girl
(Fall in love)
When you see, when you see a man beg
(Fall in love)
Now he takes some time
(Fall in love)
To go down to the corner store
(Fall in love)
Well, what I've got in mind girl
(Fall in love)
Give me 60 seconds, no more
(Fall in love)
Oh, it only takes a minute girl, baby
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute girl
(Girl)
To fall in love, let's fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love

To fall in love, let's fall in love
