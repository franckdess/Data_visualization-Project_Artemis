Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Jet
Jet

Jet, I can almost remember
The funny faces
That time you told 'em
That you were gonna be marrying soon

And Jet, I thought
The only lonely place was on the moon

Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

Jet, was your father as bold
As a Sergeant Major?
How come he told you
That you were hardly old enough yet?

And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

Ah, mater, I want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Ooh, she said
She said
Jet

And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, you know I want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Whoo, she said

Jet, with the wind in your hair
Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll
Go for a ride in the sky

And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

And yeah, don't you know that I
I thought you was a little Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh
My little lady
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
