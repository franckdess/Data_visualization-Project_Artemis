Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed?
