Tonight it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

Hear me crying out to you
You said
Never, never
Would I leave
Here's a tear
From me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart
I'll pretend
That you are here again


Give me one more chance
To make it real
