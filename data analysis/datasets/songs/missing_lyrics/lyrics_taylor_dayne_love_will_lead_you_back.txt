Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go, well, darling, I'll set you free
But I know in time that we'll be together

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure
Sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights, well, I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say how much you miss me
You walked out this door, but someday you'll walk back in
Darling I know, I know this will be

Sometimes it takes, some time out on your own now
To find your way back home


But I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know, oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
