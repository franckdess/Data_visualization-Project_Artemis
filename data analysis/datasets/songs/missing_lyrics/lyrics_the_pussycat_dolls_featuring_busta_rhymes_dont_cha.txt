Ayo, what the fuck you think a record
'Bout Pussycat Dolls featurin' Busta Rhymes is gon' sound like?
Okay (Ahh), yeah (Ahh)
Oh, we about to get it
Just a lil' hot and sweaty in this motherfucker (Ooh, baby)
Ladies, let's go (Uhh), soldiers, let's go (Dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just, you know
Give you a little situation... listen (Fellas)

You see this shit get hot, every time I come through
When I step up in the spot (Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick, yes, I'm on the lookout (Let's dance)
Slow bangin' shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (Ooh, baby)
No tricks, only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number, but make sure you call before you leave

I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fuckin' with me (Ahh)

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha? Don't cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha? (Ah-ah-ah) Don't cha?

Fight the feeling (Fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (Leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Let's keep it friendly (Let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (You have to play fair, yeah)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share (Ah, ah-ah)

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)
Don't cha? Don't cha, baby?
Don't cha? Alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me? (Raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? (Big fun)
Don't cha? (Ah-ah-ah) Don't cha?
(Okay, I see how it's goin' down
Seem like shorty wanna little m√©nage pop off or somethin'
Let's go)

Well, let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God almighty, lookin' all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish
You wanna play with a player, girl, then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on (Ha)
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wanna break my back
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon, hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get cold so I could hit the both of y'all

See, I know she loves ya (I know she loves ya)
I understand (I understand, yeah)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you if you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (Maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (Possibly)
Until then, old friend, your secret is safe with me (Shhh... hot)

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)
Don't cha? Don't cha, baby?
Don't cha? Alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me? (Raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? (Big fun)
Don't cha? (Ah-ah-ah) Don't cha?
