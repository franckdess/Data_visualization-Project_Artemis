I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry, no
I don't wanna learn the hard way
Baby, hello
Oh no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky

It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss, this kiss

Cinderella said to Snow White
"How does love get so off course, oh
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart
Soft touch, fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby, I'm forever yours"

It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss
Unsinkable
This kiss, this kiss

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, oh
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside, oh
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let everything slide
You got me floating
You got me flying

It's the way you love me (The way)
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion (Ahh, ahh)
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's criminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me, baby (The way you love me, baby)
It's the way you love me, darling, yeah

It's the way you love me (The way)
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion (Ahh, ahh)
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's criminal
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me, baby (The way you love me, baby)
It's the way you love me darling, yeah

It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
