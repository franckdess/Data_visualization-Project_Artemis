Is a remarkable So So Def
Remix
J.E. y'all
Run-DMC to the beat y'all
Ah-ha ahhh-ha
And me?
Yea I know my name

See, first of all
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah
When I think about
All these years we've put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
Then I think about
Where would I be if we were to just to fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Girl, let's just get married I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger We might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Let's get married (baby let's get married)

Said, I done it all
But frankly girl, I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
Cause, making love to just anyone ain't happening
I just gotta be with you
Do you think about
Us finishing something we started so long ago?
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about
Maybe us havin' some babies?
Come on won't you be my lady?
Forever girl...

What's going on across the seas
It ain't nothin'
I ain't frontin'
Shorty comin' with me
Now I done already gave you the key to tha Range
And your last name 'bout to change
Now you Mrs. Simmons
Gotta a betta livin'
What a difference Rev-Run made
I used to be the snake type
Hangin' out late night
Girl you done made me
Change my life
Ever since you met me
Keys to the Bentley
Now they call you the preacher's wife
I'm the type of guy that
Take you out and buy that
Ring with the rock that'll
Break your arm
Playa won't try dat
Now you can't deny that
Triple dub rev to the run dot com
Meet me at the altar
In your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger
We might as well do it
Been feelin' you all the while girl
I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Girl, let's just get married I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger We might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Let's get married (baby let's get married)
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Girl, let's just get married I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger We might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess
Let's get married (baby let's get married)
