Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
And a head full of dreams
He said somehow, someway
It's gotta get better than this
Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye
They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited
We got just one shot of life
Let's take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief
And time is a thief, when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let them put you down
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Paradise was closed
So they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a tworoom apartment
That was jumping every night of the week
Happiness was found in each other's arms
As expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears
Drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let them put you down
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Come on babe!


Young hearts, be free tonight
Time is on, on your side

Billy wrote a letter back home
To Patti's parents tryin' to explain
He said: 'We're both real sorry
That it had to turn out this way'
But there ain't no point in talking
When there's nobody listening
So we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten-pound baby boy, yeah!

Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight, time in on your side
Young hearts gotta run free
Be free, live free
Time is on, time is on your side
Time, time, time
Time is on your side
Is on your side
Is on your side
Is on your side
Young heart be free tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, yeah
