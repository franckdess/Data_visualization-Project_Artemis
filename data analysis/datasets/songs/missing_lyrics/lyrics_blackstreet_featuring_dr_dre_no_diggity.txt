No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, girl
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, oh yeah
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, babe
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

Yeah, come on
Maggie in full effect
Lisa in full effect (right)
Biggie in full effect (uh huh)
Tamika in full effect (yeah)
Blaze in full effect (right)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (no doubt)
Yeah, play on, playette
(Play on, playette)
Play on (play on) play on (play on)
'Cause I like it (right)
No diggity, no doubt
(Blackstreet productions)
We out, we out (right)
We out, we out
