I know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see, I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah, ooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me, yeah?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it, no, ooh

That's why I'm easy, yeah
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me, oh babe
Ooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, woah
'Cause I'm easy, whoo
Easy like Sunday morning, yeah
'Cause I'm easy
Easy like Sunday morning, woah
'Cause I'm easy
