There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A "No trespass" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Hah
