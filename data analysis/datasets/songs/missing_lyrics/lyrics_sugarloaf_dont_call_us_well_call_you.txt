Say hey, A and R, this is Mister Rhythm And Blues
He said, "Hello" and put me on hold
To say the least the cat was cold
He said, "Don't call us child, we'll call you"
(I said, "You got my number?"
He said, "Yeah, I got it when you walked in the door")
Don't call us, we'll call you
Don't call us, we'll call you
I got your name from a friend of a friend
Who said he used to work with you
Remember the all night creature from Stereo Ninety Two
Yeah, I said, "Could you relate to our quarter track tape
You know the band performs in the nude"
He said, "Uh huh don't call us child, we'll call you"
Listen kid, you paid for the call
You ain't bad but we've heard it all before
Yeah, it sounds like John, Paul and George
Any way we cut a hit and we toured a bit
With a song he said, he couldn't use
And now he calls and begs and crawls, it's telephone Deja Vu
We got percentage points and lousy joints
And all the glitter we can use
Mama so uh huh, don't call us, now we'll call you
Listen kid, you paid for the call
You ain't bad but I've heard it all before
Don't call us, we'll call you
