Y'all know what this is
This what you need to do girl...
So, So, Def (Let me hold you)

I been watchin' you for a minute
Come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it, I'm determined to win it
I know what you need, I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight
Everything will be all right if ya (Let me hold you)
And introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side
Of life that you ain't been seeing girl
I'ma show you where it's at
And I'ma show you how to get it
All you got do is be with it and (Let me hold you)
Down like a real man's supposed to
I never would have approached you if I ain't have intentions on doing good
See dude you with is so fooled to me girl your so cool
And all I'm asking you to do is (Let me hold you)
Down like a best friend, two homies in the game
When you cry I wanna feel your pain; no secrets, no games
All excitement, nothin' plain; keep you happy, that's my aim
And all you gotta do girl is (Let me hold you)

In my arms in my mind all the time I wanna
Keep you right by my side 'til I die I'm gonna
Hold you down and make sure everything is right with you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you
The life of somebody like you should be living
Ohhhhh, baby baby
You could never go wrong if you let me hold you

I'ma keep you up on what's poppin'
And shake you fresh to death
When we hit the mall we can ball 'til there's no more left
I know you ain't used to it but you gon get used to it
'Cause that's the only way I'm a do you and let me
(Let me hold you)
All my homies think I'm trippin' 'cause I got you a pad
See they just mad 'cause they ain't get you; they ain't get you
Scorpio is your sign and girl your so fine
And I would do whatever in no time - no shine
Its what you're coming with but I'ma change all that
Rearrange that, put you in the Range all black
With the rims to match, phone attached
TV's in the back, how you gon say no to that? Huh
(Let me hold you)
Niggas look at me like now here you go
Really bout to blow some doe
But ain't nobody did it before so why is you so go hold it
'Cause I believe this was meant to be
I just gotta work at it like a crack addict up in rehab

(Let me hold you)
In my arms in my mind all the time I wanna
Keep you right by my side 'til I die I'm gonna
Hold you down and make sure everything is right with you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you
The life of somebody like you should be living
Ohhhhh, baby baby
You could never go wrong if you let me hold you

And everybody know now what I'm tryna do

Down-down around, Atlanta-lanta, fa-found

Hold you down and make sure everything is right with you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
