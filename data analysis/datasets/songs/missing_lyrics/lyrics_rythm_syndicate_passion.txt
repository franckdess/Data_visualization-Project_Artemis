Sitting in my bedroom
The rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window
And loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing says
Don't you stay inside
But I can't fight this feeling got L.U.S.T. on my mind
I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely
But is she N.A.S.T.Y?
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Her lips are calling to me
No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z
The night is getting longer
I start to realize
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back
The S.E.X. is just too good
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I should've read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind
I must have been blind
I never knew another lover that was evil under cover
Then I discovered you, girl
You're like no other
Doing the time for the crime
I was blind
To the games that you were playing
Words that you were saying
Going out of my mind
You're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact
You got the knack to drop a man to his knees
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N
