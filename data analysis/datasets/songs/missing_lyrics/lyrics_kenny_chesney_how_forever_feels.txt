Big orange ball, sinking in the water
Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanning señoritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels
Hands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes
I want to know how forever feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

I want to know how forever feels
Hey, I want to know how forever feels
Girl, I want to know how forever feels
