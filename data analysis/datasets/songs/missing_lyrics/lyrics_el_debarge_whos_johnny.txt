There she goes and knows I'm dying
When she says "Who is Johnny?"
Games with names that girl is playing
All she says is "Who is Johnny?"
I tried to understand because I'm people too
And playing games is part of human nature
My heart's in overdrive
It's great to be alive
"Who's Johnny?" she said
And smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said
"You know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she said
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
Alright, oh yeah
She makes sure I see her teasing
Hear her say, "Who is Johnny?"
There's no way today is easy
Hear her say, "Who is Johnny?"
I really couldn't help
But fall in love with her
Her being there has made my life worth living
I knew it from the start
That I would lose my heart
"Who's Johnny?"
She said and smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said
"You know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she said
And tried to look the other way
Still pretending
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
Wow-oooh, oh no
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
Oh no-no-no-no
I don't believe it
"Who's Johnny?" she said
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
(Girls like her) Are very special girls
(Girls like her) Don't rest
('Till) 'Till you too are a believer
'Till you too have caught their fever
Who-who-who-..
"Who is Johnny?"
There she goes and knows I'm dying when she says
"Who is-who-who is" "Who's Johnny?" she said
And smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she says
"You know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she says
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
That girl's pretending she can't remember my name
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
Oh, i can't believe it
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
I know this girl is only teasing
"Who's Johnny?"
She said
She walked at me with someone else
And left me standing there, ooo-oooh
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
It isn't love...
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
Johnny come with me
"Who's Johnny?"
