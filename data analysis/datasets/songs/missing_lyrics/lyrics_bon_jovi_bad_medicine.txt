Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three

First you need, that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed, you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees, that's what you get for falling in love
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack

When you need, that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed, you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees, that's what you get for falling in love
Now I'm addicted and your kiss is the drug

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need

I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)
