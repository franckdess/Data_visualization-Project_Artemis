Remember back in high school
When you couldn't wait
For the very first dance
You lay your homework was the rule
And just thinkin' 'bout the music
Puts you in a trance
You never have to worry
If you save your lunch money
So you'll have the chance
To get your ticket in a hurry
For the high school dance
Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance
Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance
It only costs a dollar
To dance to the music
With the one you love best, uh, huh
It makes you wanna holler, ooh
The music sounds good
You just don't want to rest
And then they turn the lights down
So you can slow dance
Or sneak a little romance
All the baddest sit around
Talkin' 'bout the high school dance
Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance
Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance
Dance at the high school dance
It only costs a dollar
To dance to the music
With the one you love best, yeah
It makes you wanna holler, ooh
The music sounds good
You just don't want to rest, yeah
And then they turn the lights down
So you can slow dance
Or sneak a little romance, yeah yeah
All the baddest sit around
Talkin' 'bout the high school dance
Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance
Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance
Dance at the high school dance
