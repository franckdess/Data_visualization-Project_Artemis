There's a girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh

Ah, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere, she's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Su-Sussudio, just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Sussudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime, Su-Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
I feel so good if I just say the word, Su-Su-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Sussudio, oh

Ah, she's all I need, all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word, Su-Su-Sussudio
I just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Su-Sussudio
I just say the word, oh, Su-Su-Sussudio
I'll say the word, oh, S-Su-Su-Sussudio, oh, oh, oh

Just say the word
Just say the word, ooh
Just say the word
S-Su-Su-Sussudio, Su-Su-Sussudio
Su-Su-Sussudio, Su-Su-Sussudio
Sussudio, Su-Su-Sussudio
Just say the word, Su-Su-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh
Just say the word
