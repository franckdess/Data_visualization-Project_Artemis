A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell (captured)
Oh, yes, I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion?
Should I?
Should I?

Oh, you better be good to me!
That's how it's got to be now
Cause I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good, good
C'mon, c'mon, be good to me

I think it's all so right
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case
Yes, I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do want to believe
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith?
Oh, sure, babe, anything to please you!

But you better be good to me
That's how it's got to be now
Cause I don't have the time for your overloaded lines
And you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good
Be good to me

And I really don't see why it's so hard to be
Good to me, and, you know
I don't understand, what's your plan
That you can't be good to me
What I can't feel I surely cannot see
Why can't you be good to me
And if it's not real, I do not wish to see
Why don't you be good to me

Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Be good, good to me
Be good to me
'Cause I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time for your overloaded lies
So you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good
Better be good to me
Better be good
'Cause I don't have the time for your overloaded lies
And I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
(Why can't you be) be good to me
(Why can't you be) be good
(Why can't you be) be good to me
(Why can't you be)
'Cause I don't have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time for your overloaded lies
You better be good to me
(Why can't you be) good to me
(Why can't you be) good to me
Be good
Be good to me
Why can't you be (Why can't you be) good to me (Be good to me)
Why can't you be (Why can't you be) good to me (Be good to me)
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Be good to me
