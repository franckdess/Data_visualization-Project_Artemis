I hear people sayin'. We Don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend
Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right
Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for
Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?!
