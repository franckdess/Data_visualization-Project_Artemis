Downtown, we'll drown
We're in our never splendor
Flowers, showers
Who's got the new boy gender?
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumbel for you
Uptown, their sound
It's like the native, you send her
Junction, function
The boy with pop is slender
Did he say maybe, or I'm not sure?
He'll be a boy for you, but you need more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumbel for you
I get a crazy feeling
Which paces in my head
It's nothing that you do to me
It's nothing that you said
It's love in stereo
And when I can't let go
I say
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for you
