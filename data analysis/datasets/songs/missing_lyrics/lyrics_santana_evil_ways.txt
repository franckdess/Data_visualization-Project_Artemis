{Intro}
You've got to change your evil ways, baby
Before I stop lovin' you
You've got to change, baby
And every word that I say is true
You got me runnin' and hidin' all over town
You got me sneakin' and a-peepin' and runnin' you down
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby
When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby
{Bridge}
When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, yeh yeh yeh
{Outro}
