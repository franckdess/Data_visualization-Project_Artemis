Ah, ah
Hey
Ah, oh
Mmm

Baby
Baby, yeah
Are you listening?

Wondering where you've been all my life
I've just started livin'
Ooh-oh, baby
Are you listening? Ah

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

Baby, when you hear me
When I'm crying out for you
I'm scared, oh, so scared
Oh, when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army 
Of men armed with weapons
Yeah, oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When he led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
