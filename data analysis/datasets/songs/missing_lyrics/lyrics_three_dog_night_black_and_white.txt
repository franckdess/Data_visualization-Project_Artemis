The ink is black
The page is white
Together we learn
To read and write
To read and write
The slate is black
The chalk is white
The words stand out
So clear and bright
So clear and bright
A child is black
A child is white
The whole world looks
Up on the sight
A beautiful sight
And now a child
Can understand
This is the law
Of all the land
AII the land
And now at last
We plainly see
The alphabet
Of Liberty
Liberty
A child is black
A child is white
The whole world looks
Up on this sight
The world is black
The world is white
It turns by day
And then by night
It turns by night
