"Hi! We're not in right now
But if you leave your name and number
We'll get back to you, to you, to you" (laughing)

I got all this love, waiting just for you
I just gotta know, that your love is true
Can't keep running boy, in and out my life
Wanna be your girl, not cause the mood is right

If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold me
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest my love

Don't walk away boy, (ooh don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (no no)
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you

You say all the things, that I like to hear
You push all my buttons baby
Love to have you close to me
Wanna feel your love, wanna be for sure
That it's me you need baby, each and every night

Baby, don't misunderstand
I want you for my man
I need a little time
Before I give you my love
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you

Don't walk away
This is what it sounds like
When we're making love
Don't walk away boy
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you
(Till fade)
