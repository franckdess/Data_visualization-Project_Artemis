Oo-oh, oo-oh
(Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay)
Put you to bed, bed, bed
Put you to bed, bed, bed

Girl, change into that Victoria's Secret thing that I like -
Alright
Okay tonight you're having me your way
Perfume
Spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Finna raise the temp' in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there (uh huh) right there (uh)
You touch me like you care
Now stop
And let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Workin' that nine to five and stayin' cute like you do
Oh, oh, oh

I love it (I love it)
You love it (you love it)
Everytime (everytime)
We touchin' (we touchin')
I want it (I want it)
You want it (you want it)
I'll see you (see you)
In the mornin' (in the mornin')

Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'mma rock ya body
Turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed

I'm starin' at you while you sleep
Irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (Ooh, breathe)
Take you into my senses
Wake up it's time to finish
Round two, round two
Matter of fact, it's closer to three
She like, "How long I been sleep?"
Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me
"My angel, this is wonderful"
Thanks for letting me bless ya
Come down, fly right
Drift back into heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I love it (I love it)
You love it (you love it)
Everytime (everytime)
We touchin' (we touchin')
I want it (I want it)
You want it (you want it)
I'll see you (see you)
In the mornin' (in the mornin')

Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'mma rock ya body
Turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
The sun ain't the only thing that's shinin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Now I'mma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody, Ay
Everybody
Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay, Ay-ay-ay, Ay
