Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers, staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... Mmm

And it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
Ta-da-dam, ta-da, da-dam, ta-da-dam, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-dam
Um-ba, da-da, um-ba, ta-da-da-da, uhm

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holding me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever you go, I always know
'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while
