In the past there were arguments for and against casual sex. Then it became a question of morality. These days it can be a question of life or death. It's as simple as that. And this song is not about casual sex

There’s things that you guess
And a'things a'that you know
There’s boys you can trust
And a'girls that you don’t
There’s little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you’re gonna get it
But you don’t and that’s just the way it goes

I swear I won’t tease you
Won’t tell you no lies
Don’t need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I’ve a'waited so long baby
Now that we’re friends
Every man’s got his patience
And here’s where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex

It’s playin' on my mind
It’s dancin' on my soul
It’s taken so much time
So why don’t you just let me go
I’d really like to try
Oh, I’d really love to know
When you tell me you’re gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no

I swear I won’t tease you
Won’t tell you no lies
Don’t need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I’ve waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can’t take much more girl
I’m losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your…sex (sex! ow!)

It’s natural, it’s chemical (let’s do it)
It’s logical habitual (can we do it?)
It’s sensual but most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you
Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it’s one on one
One on one
Hoo ah (sex) I’m not your father
Hoo ah (sex) I’m not your brother
Hoo ah (sex) talk to your sister
Hoo ah (sex) I am a lover
Hoo ah (sex)
Hoo ah (sex)
Hoo ah (sex)
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on
What’s your definition of dirty baby?
What do you consider pornography?
Don’t you know I love it till it hurts me baby?
Don’t you think it’s time you had sex with me?
What’s your definition of dirty baby?
What do you call pornography?
Don’t you know I love it till it hurts me baby?

Oh so much love, that you’ve never seen
Let’s make love, put your trust in me (hmm)
Don’t you listen to what they told you
Because I love you, let me hold you
Oh, I’m not your brother
I’m not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind?
I’m a gentle lover with a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkind...oh
Come on
I want your sex
Come on, I want your sex
That’s right, all night
Oh, I want your sex
I want your…sex
Sexy baby’s (Sexy baby’s)
Sexy body (Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)
With a promise (Oh)
I know we can come together
But the question is Will we ever ever?
