If I were your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out that door
My love would overrule my sense
And I'd call you back for more

If I were your woman (if you were my woman)
If I were your woman (if you were my woman)
And you were my man

Yeah
She tears you down, darling
Says you're nothing at all (nothing at all)
But I'll pick you up, darling
When she lets you fall
You're like a diamond (shining)
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me you don't ask

If I were your woman (if you were my woman)
If I were your woman (if you were my woman)
If I were your woman (if you were my woman)
Here's what I'd do
I'd never no, no stop loving you
Yeah, yeah, mmm

Life is so crazy and love is unkind
Because she came first, darling
Will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me
And you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

If I were your woman
(If you were my woman)
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
(If I were your woman)
If you were my woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never no, no stop loving you

If I were your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
If I were your woman
You're sweet loving woman
You'd need no other woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
(If you were my woman)
If I were your woman
(If you were my woman)
I'd be you're only woman
You'd have no other woman
