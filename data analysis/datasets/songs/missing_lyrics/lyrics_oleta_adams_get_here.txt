You can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trail-way
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can
You can reach me by sailboat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer
(Musical break)
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer
You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can
I don't care, I don't care, I need you right here right now
I need you right here, right now, right by my side
Yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can
