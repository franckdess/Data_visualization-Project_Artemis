I'm leavin' it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove
Or are we through
That's why I'm leaving it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove
Or are we through
I've got my heart in my hand
I-I don't understand
Baby, what, what have I done wrong
I worship the ground that you walk on
That's why I'm leavin' it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove
Or are we through
I'm leavin' it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove
Or are we through

I'm leavin' it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
