Hit my plug, that's my cholo (Mi amigo)
Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco (Go crazy)
Hit you with that treinta ocho (Pah, pah)
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo
Fifty deep, they like, "Oh, no" (No, no, no, please, no)
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothin', fuck the po-po

Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga (Woo, woo, woo, woo)

36, that's a kilo (Aquí)
Need a brick, miss my free throw (They white)
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo (Matrix)
Free my homies, fuck the C.O. (Puto)
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O. (Puto)
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, like I'm Nemo

Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
