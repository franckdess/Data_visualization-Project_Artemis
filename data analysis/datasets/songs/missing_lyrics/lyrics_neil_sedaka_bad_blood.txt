It could've been me
But it was you
Who went and bit off
A little bit more
Than he could chew
You said that you had it made
But you been had
The woman no good
No how
Thinking maybe the blood is bad
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink of an eye
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change your mind
About all you believe
From where I stand
It looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that
Treat you like small change
I don't understand
What you're lookin' to find
The only thing bad blood do
Is mess up a good man's mind
Hear me talkin' now
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Bad blood, talking 'bout bad blood
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Doo-ron, doo-ron, di di
Dit, dit, do-ron-ron
Bad blood, here we go
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child
Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide
The only thing good about bad blood
Is letting it slide
