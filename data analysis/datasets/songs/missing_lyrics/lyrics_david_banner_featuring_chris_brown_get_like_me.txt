Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit

I got a chip in my engine, 26 inch rims
I got fade-away money, bitch, I'm ballin' out the gym
Got my old school pumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind (ayy)
Diamonds on my pinky (ayy), hand on the pine
Bitch touch and now your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got Gs on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain, 84s on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air

The name you know of
A little bit of change, now your boy done blown up
In them foreign thangs with the guts exposed
Stunting ain't a thing to me, and it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stunting is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty keep throwing that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life, but if you did ya homework
Girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got, drop-tops
And you know Jones and Banner gonna roll, let me stop
Stunting is a habit

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get, get like me

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin', them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, "Sweet"
But black folks go, "Oh," I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get like me

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
