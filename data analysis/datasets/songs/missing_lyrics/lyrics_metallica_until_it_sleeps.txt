Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open and pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now, it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me (yeah)
It hates you so hold me (yeah)
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps (Until it sleeps)
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me (yeah)
It holds you
Holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps (Until it sleeps)
Until it sleeps (Until it sleeps, until it sleeps)

I don't want it, I don't want it
Want it, want it, want it, want it, no, woah-woah

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til I'm clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps

Until it sleeps, until it sleeps
Until it sleeps, until it sleeps
