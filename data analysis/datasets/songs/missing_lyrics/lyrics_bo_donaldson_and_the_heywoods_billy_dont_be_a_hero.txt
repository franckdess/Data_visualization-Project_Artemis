The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line
And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife
And as he started to go
She said, "Billy, keep your head low."
Billy, don't be hero
Come back to me

The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, "We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground."
I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men."
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said


I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud
He died that way
I heard she threw the letter away
