I wanna tease you
I wanna please you
I wanna show you baby, that I need you
I want your body 'til the very last drop
I want you to holler when you want me to stop

And who can love you like me? (Nobody)
Who can sex you like me? (Nobody)
Who can treat you like me, my baby? (Nobody)
Nobody, baby (Nobody)
And who can do it like me? (Nobody)
Who can give you what you need? (Nobody)
Who can do you all night long? (Nobody)
Nobody, baby (Nobody)

I want the night for me and you
So come here, baby, and let me do it to you
Don't be afraid 'cause I won't bite
I promise to give it to you just the way you like

And who can love you like me? (Nobody)
Who can sex you like me? (Nobody)
And who can lay your body down? (Nobody)
Nobody, baby (Nobody)
And who can treat you like me? (Nobody)
Who can give you what you need? (Nobody)
Who can do you all night long? (Nobody)
Nobody, baby (Nobody)
And the band keeps playin' on

On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
Nobody, baby
On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
On, on, on, and on, on
Nobody, baby

I want you right now for my lover (Oh yes I do)
Place no one above you (Oh yes I do)
If you need a love (Oh)
I'll be right there, I'll be right there, baby
I'll come runnin', oh baby (Oh yes I will)
Oh, yes, I will (Oh)
Oh, yes, I will, baby

And who can love you like me, baby? Nobody
(I'm gonna love you baby)
Who can sex your body right, baby? Nobody
(Like nobody can)
No, no no no no no (Nobody, baby)
Who can lay you down just like me? Nobody
Who can kiss you  (I'm gonna caress your body right)
