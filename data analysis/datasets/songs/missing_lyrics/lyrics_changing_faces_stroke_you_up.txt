Turn the lights down half way
Huh, hey yo that's cool
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)

All through the night (I don't mind)
Until your body's tired
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Makin' you feel so right
C'mon in and close the door

Dim the lights, unplug the phone
And turn the radio on
I've got what you need
Just put your trust in me
And I won't let you down
So give me your love right now
Give it up (that's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin' (don't stop)
I've got a question for you
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
