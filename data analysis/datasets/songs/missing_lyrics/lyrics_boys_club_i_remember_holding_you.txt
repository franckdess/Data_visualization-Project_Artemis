Time will never lose
Memories we choose
Choices that we've made for love
Voices in my head
They call me away
You were right beside me
I'm in love

Maybe I should have known it
Maybe I should have seen
But I stayed lost in my dreams
Now that you're gone

I remember holding you
Feeling felt so right
Now I find I'm reaching out
In the middle of the night
All those things
I should have said
Now my chance is gone
All alone
I'm reaching out
Even though I know
It's wrong, so wrong

We will never know
What my heart will never show
I will keep it all inside
Somehow when I tried
You knew that I lied
In my heart
I feel untrue



Oh, I know
I know, I know
I know it's wrong
All the times I should have seen
Everything you meant to me
Now I only hold you in my dreams

I remember holding you
I remember holding you
(I know, I know)
(I know, I know it's wrong)
I remember holding you
I remember holding you
I remember holding you
(Feeling felt so right)
Felt so right
All those things
I should have said
(Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah)
I remember holding you
