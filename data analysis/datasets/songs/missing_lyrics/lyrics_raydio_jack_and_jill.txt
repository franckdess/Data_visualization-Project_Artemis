Jack (Jack)
Wanting someone to feel (Feel)
Sat up on the hill (Hill)
And waited all day for Jill

Jill (Jill)
Always away from home (Home)
Never bothering to phone (Phone)
Always leavin' poor Jack alone

Now, why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
(He snuck down the hill)
'Cause he needed love
(He needed)
Love he couldn't get from Jill
(Oh, yes, he did)
Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
(He snuck down the hill, yeah)
He needed love (Oh, yes, he did)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill

Jack (Jack)
Like Little Red Riding Hood (Hood)
Always tryin' to do good (Good)
Waited as long as he could

Jill (Jill)
Is it right or wrong (Wrong)
For Jack to carry on (On)
If you leave him home too long

Now, why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
(He snuck down, he snuck down, broke his crown)
He needed love (Sweet love)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill
(Ah, sweet, sweet love, uh-huh)
Why do you think (Hey-ha)
Jack snuck down the hill
(He snuck down the hill, yeah)
He needed love (Oh, yes, he did)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill (Yeah, oh)
(Jack)
(Jill)
(Jack)
(Jill)

Now, why do you think
(Why do you think)
Jack snuck down the hill
(Why do you think he snuck down the hill)
'Cause he needed love
(He needed love)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill
(Yes, he did)
Now, why do you think
(He got down on his right knee)
Jack snuck down the hill
(He had mud on his hands)
He needed love
(And he crawled and he crawled)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill
(And he crawled for so long)
Now, why do you think (Heeeeeey)
Jack snuck down the hill
(He snuck down, he snuck down, broke his crown)
'Cause he needed love (He needed love)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill
(He wanted sweet, sweet love, yeah)

Now, why do you think (Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
Jack snuck down the hill (Oh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
He needed love (Oh-ooh-ho-oh, yeah)
(He needed) Love he couldn't get from Jill
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now why do you think
