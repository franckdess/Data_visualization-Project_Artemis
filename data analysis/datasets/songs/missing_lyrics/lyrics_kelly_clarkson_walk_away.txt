You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say (What to say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger
Oh, yeah
You need to know this situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I waited here for you like a kid waiting after school
So tell me how come you never showed? (Never showed)
I gave you everything and never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (Alone)
So, before you start defending
Baby, stop all your pretending
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow?
Let's get the show on the road today
Hey!

I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I wanna love, I wanna fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then boy, just leave

I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Walk away)
Just walk away

If you don't have the answer (Walk away)
Just walk (walk) away
(Just walk away)
Then just leave
Yeah, yeah
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
