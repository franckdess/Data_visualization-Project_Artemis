You're my world, you're every breath I take
You're my world, you're every move I make
Other eyes see the stars up in the skies
But for me they shine within your eyes
As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine
You're my world you are my night and day
You're my world you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine
You're my world you are my night and day
You're my world you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world
End of my world
End of my world for me
