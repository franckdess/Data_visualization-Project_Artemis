{Intro}
Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?
I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?
Her and Bobby were steppin' out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?
So I asked her if she still cared
She didn't hear me, she just stared
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?
And then she said
Lee you haven't loved me in nearly four years
You haven't noticed that I held back my tears
And now you have, but it's really too late
Better find yourself another girl
Better find another girl
Better find uh, another place
{Pause}
She just left me yesterday
She just left me, had nothing to say
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, do you know what I mean?
She's a dandy, yes indeed
She's a dandy, but now she's free
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean? Yeah
Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?
I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, learn how to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, here comes it now..
