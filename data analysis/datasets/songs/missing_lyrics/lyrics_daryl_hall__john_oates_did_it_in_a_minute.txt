When you find yourself alone
And when going out is coming home
Well, you can count on the kid
'Cause there's nobody waiting around, oh, oh
If you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
And I know, I know, I know, I know when it's coming
I thought so anyway
Some things stay the same
And some are due for change
I thought I had them all nailed down
But you turned it around
Oh, you did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I know, I know, I know, I know you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
Well, I still can't say
I know when a love is real or touch and go
And if two can be one
Who is the one two becomes, oh, oh
Am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me?
I say, I say, I say, I say that I want it
I think so anyway
Everybody always laughs at love
But what they want is to be proven wrong
Then you came along
Oh, you did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I know, I know, I know, oh, I know you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it, yeah
I know, I know, I know, I know you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I did it really 
But you you did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I know, I know, I know, oh
You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I want someone to prove I'm wrong
You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I know, I know, I know, I know you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
You messin' with my love life
You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
I know, I know, I know, I know you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
Wow, ooh, wow, ooh, oh
You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute, you did it
