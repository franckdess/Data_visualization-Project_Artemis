Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I’m coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you’re winning
And they’re playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think that I’m crazy
But you know I’m just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There’s a spark in-between us
When we’re dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I’m asking you tonight

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

Give me something good
Don’t wanna wait, I want it now
Drop it, like a hood
And show me how you work it out
Alright

If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
