Uh
Uh
Yeah
Uh
Ow, ow, ow
Uh
Giddy up
Get up, get up, get up (Ciara)

He said, "Hi, my name is so and so
Baby, can you tell me yours?
You look like you came to do one thing" (Set it off)
I started on the left
Then I had to take him to the right
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night

You tryin', admit it
But you just can't fight the feeling inside
You know it
And I can see it in your eyes
You want me
You smooth as a mother
You're so undercover
By the way that you was watchin' me

Ooh, uh
The way you look at me, I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it, tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh
When you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you
Move, ring the alarm
The club is jumpin' now
So get up

I said, "Ciara's on your radio
Everybody turn it up"
Spicy just like hot sauce
Careful, you might burn it up
You can do the pop lock
Rag-top, don't stop
That's the way you gotta get
Get it, make your body rock

You trying, admit it
But you just can't fight the feeling inside
You know it
'Cause I can see it in your eyes
You want me
You smooth as a mother
You're so undercover
By the way that you was watchin' me

Ooh, uh
The way you look at me, I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it, tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh
When you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you
Move, ring the alarm
The club is jumpin' now
So get up

Ooh, I love the way you vibe with me
Dance with me forever
We can have a good time, follow me (Follow me)
To the beat together (To the beat)
You and me, one on one
Breakin' it down
You can't walk away now (Oh)
We got to turn this place out
Ooh, ooh

It's the kid that stay ridin' big
The one police tried to catch ridin' dirty
In the club before eleven o'clock
Like I'm tryna catch a dime kinda early
Lookin' thick, her hair brown and curly
She love the way my ride shinin' pearly
City boys say she fine and pretty
And the country boys say she fine and purty (Yeah)
My pockets thick, it's green, it's curvy
And the ladies know soon as they see my jewelry
If bein' fresh to death is a crime
I think it's time for me to see the jury
You know Chamillionaire stay on the grind
A hustler like me is hard to find
I ain't really impressed, yes
Unless it's about some dollar signs
Ain't really no need to call you fine
I know you be hearin' that all the time
Watchin' you do your step, do your step
And yep, it's going down

Ooh, uh
The way you look at me, I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it, tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh
When you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you
Move, ring the alarm
The club is jumpin' now
So get up
Ooh, uh
The way you look at me, I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it, tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh
When you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you
Move, ring the alarm
The club is jumpin' now
So get up

I got to have you, baby
Uh, I feel it
I got to have you, baby
I got to have you, baby
Uh, I feel it
I got to have you, baby
