(Please listen to the remix
Pl-pl-pl-pl-please listen to the remix)
Ugh. Oww. Oww, it's play
(Kris Kross)
Boogie da bang
(Redman remix)
No one can do this better than me
(Uh, rock on)
Funk Doctor Spock, comin', got your block on lock
Redman in the house one time
Tear the house down two or three times
(Come on)

Who got you open, scopin' out the track
It's no other than the sounds of the Daddy Mac
Still slackin', back, patchin' up my turf
'Cause after me was a fact the real words at the worst
Stompin', jumpin' wannabes
Better but now however there's only one M-A-C
Me and Daddy for the big picture
Ways of gettin' richer, 'Mister quick to hit your sister'
I'm ballin' in the green county on chrome
I slip brothers in the deck, on my cellular phone
(I'm just loungin', leather, sounds all around
And a dip on the other end wantin' to put me down now)
No hesitation, I hops to it
See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it
(True which usually I represent it right
But I'm the M-A-C D-A double D-Y and...)

Tonight's the night
Please, my whole crew makes G's
Tonight's the night, baby, so blow up on these
(Tonight...Tonight is the night)
(J.D.: Please listen to the remix
Pl-pl-pl-pl-please listen to the remix)
Tonight's the night, please
My whole crew makes G's
Tonight's the night, baby, so blow up on these
(Tonight...Tonight is the night)
(J.D.: Please listen to the remix
Redman, rock on)

I was born to beat MC's down to oblivia
Nobody touches the superb superior
Mind interior blown on all visitors
Steppin' in my physical perimeter, ha
I rock zones in three cornerstones of the Earth
I work butter, the eye-shutter, burst
If you wanna test the lyrical expert
I'll start jumpin' like grandmas in church
Def Squad representer
Be representin' hood boogers, Buddha Mics and cash-getters
Dutch Master fillers, hash and ass kickers
Real criminals, group homes and gat clickers
The way I rap, I impress niggas
You damn right I'm gettin' cheddar from them So So Def niggas
Watch the Bricks get thicker
O-7-1-O-3 be flowin' Dom at the tunnel
Blaze the blunt, take it toke
Prove you that ill MC from that slick shit you wrote
I know you kinda folks, you just run and skip town
Your girl rock my shit and you turn my shit down
Now 'how's that' from the Keith Murray LP
Pop Cristal forever whoever could nail me
Straight up, Def Squad 'til I die
I stay chinky-eyed with the nigga with green eyes

(Tonight)
Kris Kross, rock on
Redman, rock on
(Tonight)
So So Def, rock on
(Tonight is the night)
Def Squad, rock on
Kris Kross, rock on
Redman, rock on
(Tonight)
So So Def, rock on
(Tonight is the night)
Def Squad, rock on
Get ready...tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready...tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Tonight
