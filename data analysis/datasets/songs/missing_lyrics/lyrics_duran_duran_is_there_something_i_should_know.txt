Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now

I made a break, I run out yesterday
Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year, maybe no go
I know you're watching me
Every minute of the day, yeah
I've seen the signs
And the looks and the pictures
That give your game away, yeah
There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way?
Do you feel the same, cause you don't let it show?

People stare
And cross the road from me
And jungle drums
They all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind
Can you see in the snow
And fiery demons all dance
When you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me
You're about as easy as a nuclear war
There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way?
Do you feel the same, cause you don't let it show?
Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way?
Please, please tell me now
Can you see what makes me blow
Can you see how much I'd die
Every time it passes by
Please, please tell me now
What it takes to make it show
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should know?
