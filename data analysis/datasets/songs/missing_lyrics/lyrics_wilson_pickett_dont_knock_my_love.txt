If my love, don't hold you up
And my kisses, won't shake your stuff
Don't be afraid, let me know
There's other places, baby, that I can go

If you don't like it, don't knock it
Somebody else, might go and rock it
Oh, if you don't need it, don't waste it
Somebody else, might wanna taste it

Ah, baby, Ah, baby, if the thrill, don't turn you on
And the will is much too strong
Don't waste my time, with your foolish ways
I got other things, to do with my days

If you don't like it, don't knock it
Somebody else, might go and rock it
Hey, if you don't need it, don't waste it
Somebody else, might wanna taste it

Ah, hey, ooo, Lord, Lord, ooww!
Coolin' love, coolin' down
Coolin' all-all, all the way around town
Hug me once, that turn you on
I'm the same one to leave you alone
Don't knock my love, don't knock my love
Don't knock my love baby, don't knock my love
Ah, good god almighty, it's alright

Hey, hey, yeah
Don't knock my love, don't knock my love
