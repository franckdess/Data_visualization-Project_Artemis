I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
Wanna go outside in the rain

Cause I, I think I'm gonna cry
And I, I don't want you to see me cry

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
Wanna go outside in the rain

Once the rain starts falling on my face
You won't see a single trace
Of the tears I'm crying, because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry, let me go, let me go, let me go
(In the rain)

Once the sun comes out and the rain has gone away
I know I'm gonna see a better day
Right now I think I'm crying, because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry, let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
Wanna go outside in the rain
I wanna go outside, I wanna go outside, I wanna go outside
