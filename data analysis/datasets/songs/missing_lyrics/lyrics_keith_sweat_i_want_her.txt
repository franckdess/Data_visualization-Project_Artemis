Seen you last night, saw you standing there
And couldn't picture the color of your hair
And all I wanted to know, were you really there?
I wanna know, was it my imagination?
Ooh, you know it was a sweet sensation
Looking at you from a distance
Ooh, it seems so real

You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real, all I know is

I want her
(I want that baby)
I want her
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
I want her
(I wanna do it like this, do it like that)
I want her
(Once I get it, ain't no turning back)

You turn me on and on
This feeling, girl, is so strong
My heart, girl, is on fire
Ooh, you're my desire

I've got a thing for you
Dreams of you and me, baby
She's bad, she's bad, she's bad
All I know is

I want her
(I want, I want, I want, I want, I want her)
I want her
(Don't misunderstand me)
I want her
(I wish this dream was for real)
I want her
(You, you know the deal)
I want her
(Yeah, yeah)
I want her
(I want that girl so bad)
I want her
(I had a dream of her last night)
I want her
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I, I
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, ooh, baby
All night long, girl

I want her
(Ooh, baby)
I want her
(I want that girl so bad)
I want her
(All night long)
I want her
(Let me tell you something, I wanna do it like this, baby)
I want her
(I wanna do it like that, sugar)
I want her
(You know what I need, girl
You know what I like, girl)
I want her
(Like this, baby)
I want her
(I wanna do it like that, sugar)
I want her
(You turn me on and on and on and on, baby)
I want her
(I wanna do it like this, baby
I wanna do it like that, sugar)
I want her
(You know what I mean, girl
You know what I like, girl)
I want her
(I wanna do it like this, baby
I wanna do it like that, sugar)
I want her
(Ooh, I want you so bad, girl)
I want her
(I need you right now, baby)
I want her
(Give it to me, give it to me all night long, girl
I just want you so bad, girl)
I want her
(I just need you so bad, girl
Come on, girl, come on, girl)
I want her
I want her
I want her
(Baby)
I want her
(Don't let this be a dream, girl)
I want her
(I want you so bad, ooh baby)
I want her
(Give it to me tonight, girl)
I want her
(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me down)
I want her
I want her
I want her
(This feeling, girl, is so so so so so so
I want you so bad, baby
Was it a dream last night, girl?)
