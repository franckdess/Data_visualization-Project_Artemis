Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yeah, what do you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You let her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright...

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
