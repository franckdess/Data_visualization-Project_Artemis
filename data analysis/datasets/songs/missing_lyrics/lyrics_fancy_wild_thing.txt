Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything groovy
Wild thing
Wild thing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
I love you
Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything groovy
Wild thing
------ instrumental break ------
Wild thing, I think you move me
But I wanna know for sure
So c'mon and hold me tight
You move me
Wild thing
You make my heart sing
You make everything groovy
Wild thing
Wild thing
C'mon, c'mon, wild thing
Shake it, shake it, wild thing
