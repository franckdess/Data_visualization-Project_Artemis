Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

Baby, you told me that you love me and you'd never leave my side
Through the bitter end, through the thick and thin
You promised me, baby, that you wasn't going anywhere, yes you did
Baby, keep it real, let me know just how you feel

Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

I can't explain the way you make me feel
Everytime that you tell me that you love me
And you know you did, so many times
Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me
That's when you came along
And showed me happiness
Baby, you are the best
I think you're different from the rest
I really love you

Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

Tell me it's real
This feeling that I feel
Tell me it's real
For your love
I will do anything

Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

Do you really love me? Do you really care? You promised that
You'd never leave my side, you promised that you'd always be there
And Momma told me take it slow
Boy you just don't know
Anything about love
If you and I were meant to be
You would know
It would show
By the end of the son
