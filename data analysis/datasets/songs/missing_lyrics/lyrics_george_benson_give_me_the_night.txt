Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world coming out to dance

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night

So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers cause I see that starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly

Just gimme the night
Gimme the night

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night

So come on out tonight and we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right then we can be lovers
Cause I see that starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly

And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
Gimme the night
So, gimme the night
