Kane is in the building, nigga
It's Mr. Steal Yo Girl
It's Mr. Steal Yo Girl
Let's go

Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up

You know what it is, girl, we back up in this thang
Money stay in my pocket, girl, I'm like a walkin' bank
Tell me whatcha drank, tell me whatcha thank
If I go get these bottles, we go alcohol insane

Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga you can move to the, move to the, move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up

My vision's blurred, my words slurred
It's jam-packed, a million girls
And I ain't tryna leave, though
We drunk so let me be your alcohol hero

Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city
Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride
Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga you can move to the move to the move to the side

Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up

Yo, could I get that 'Trón? Could I get that Remy?
Could I get that Coke? Could I get that Henny?
Could I get that margarita on the rock rock rocks?
Could I get that salt all around that rim rim rim rim?
Trey, I was like "Yo, Trey"
Do you think you could buy me a bottle of Rosé?
Okay, let's get it now
I'm with a bad bitch, he's with his friends
I don't say "Hi", I say "keys to the Benz"
Keys to the Benz? Keys to the Benz
Motherfuckin' right, yeah, V to the 10
If a bitch tryna get cute I'ma stomp her
Throw a lot of money at her then yell "Fuck her!
Fuck her! Fuck her!", then yell, "Fuck her!"
Then I'ma go get my Louisville Slugger
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm really such a lady
I rep Young Money, you know Slim, Baby?
And we be doin' donuts while we wavin' the .380
We give a lot of money to the babies out in Haiti
Yellin' all around the world
Do you hear me? Do you like my body?
Anna Nicki
Rest in peace to Anna Nicole Smith
Yes, my dear, you're so explosive
Say "Hi" to Mary, Mary and Joseph
Now bottoms up and double my dosage

Bottoms up, bottoms up, ayy, what's in ya cup?
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we 'bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up, up, up
